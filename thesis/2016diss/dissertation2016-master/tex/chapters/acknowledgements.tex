\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Daniel Beck for making time and giving me alternative ideas as well as Mortaza Doulaty for his input, links and general knowledge. Their insight in related research topics proved more useful then they know. I would also like to thank Dr. Lucia Specia and Dr. Mark Stevenson for helping me wade through the department's maze of corpora. Without their help finding the correct corpus files, debugging code without data would be horrific. I would like to acknowledge and thank my supervisor, Dr. Andreas Vlachos for the helpful insight and perspective on models, data and approaches to research. I would have been lost without his suggestions and ability to comprehend data and infer relationships on models and results. Finally, I would like to thank my wife Giuseppina Silvestri who encouraged and supported me on my decision to study Natural Language Processing more in depth and to return to University and complete an MSc in Computer Science.
