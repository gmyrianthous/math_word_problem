I mean , I do n't care if he does n't know , but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face , there 's no way I 'm going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing .
When having your car worked on you have to trust the mechanic & this Midas is truly someone you can trust !
I was n't going to use them again , but I was going to leave it at that .
I really enjoyed meeting her and happy to learn she comes from Oklahoma and has the values of a solid no bs country girl .
I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods .
Not only did it taste wonderful , but the texture was unbelievable , the frosting was n't overly sweet to over power the cake , and the cake itself was just amazingly soft , and fluffy , and just perfect overall .
Tourists like the other reviewer might not appreciate their efficiency or quality , but I certainly do .
I typically have work done on my Jeep at the dealership , but it is 6 years old now and getting charged dealership prices just did n't seem cost effective anymore .
( I am also a little suspicious of all these glowing reviews ... )
the staff is very personable & actually care about the customers safety rather than taking there money .
I grew up in a small town where you knew and trusted your mechanic and was really cynical about city auto repair shops since I moved here , but Phet has shown that there really are honest hard working mechanics around .
The office is shared with a foot doctor and it 's very sterile and medical feeling , which I liked .
We 've had about 5 repairs done on 3 different laptops .
As a native southern Californian I can tell you that this is not authentic Mexican food .
However , I still like this place a lot .
Esp. the mole , tortilla soup , and guacamole .
Margaritas are alright .
My only complaint is the QUESO .
It used to be fabulous , why did you guys change it ??
Queso should not be watery :( .....
*** update *** NEVER MIND !
They fixed the queso !
Thank you thank you
It was a Saturday and my spring was broken ...
I googled Garage Door Repair in Woodinville and found NDI - Johnette answered the phone and was oh - so pleasant and helpful !
She sort of appologized for Dan taking the day off to go skiing - but he could do the repair on Sunday !
I enjoyed speaking with Dan , and learning more about how the springs are sized for these doors .
The repair went quickly and the price was extremely fair .
I would highly recommend NDI - and will spread the word to my neighbors .
Thanks Dan and Johnette for your responsiveness and professional service .

The Best Deals in Town
Their selection is random , so what they have on a given week might never be available again at the store .
I love it for discounted beauty items and household appliances .
Trust me , you go there once and you -ll always go back !
He 's great !
I wo n't go to anyone else .
Thank you for fixing the leak on my bathroom !
Thanks !

I paid 2 k cash for a truck with a blown motor .
Their so called mechanic said the engine was good and " There is nothing mechanicly wrong with this truck " .
Anyway they jimmy rigged it so i could drive it home .
The next day i took it to 2 auto shops and they both told me the same thing , engine is junk .
I called and got the same runaround on hold and noone calls you back .
From a moral standpoint , you guys are really gon na take 2,000 bucks from someone that needs that truck to work and support his family when you know it s just a piece of scrap metal ?
If it lasted 1 month i could suck it up but 1 day ?
Grimy work you guys do .
Buy your kids somethin nice with my 2 k bucks .
heating system Angels
seriously , can you imagine having to live through these last few nights without heat ?
Comfort zone came out and did my house heat on the cheap .
and it works !
Thank you Comfort Zone
HORRIBLE SERVICE !!!
They are very rude over the phone and in person .
They talk down to you like they are supreme beings , if you hate your job so much then quit !!
How these guys can get away with being so rude with people is mind blowing .
I will NEVER do business with Sun Toyota again .
Thank god there are plenty of Toyota dealerships to choose from in this city .
Compare to last decade this University is gaining more prestige in International level
I would understand if I was being treated this way by a staff member but the club 's actual OWNER ?!
The equipment and classes are n't good enough to deal with the rudeness from the staff !!!
There are better places on the Cape - FITNESS 500 !
Beautiful hotel !
Great service - high class !
Shuttle available to a private beach area with food / drinks / towels .
Very Accomodating
We were in Springfield , IL for a family funeral from Kansas City .
We arrived early and the staff was very accomodating to our families and the situation we were in .
The rooms were very clean , including the microwave and refrigerator .
This is a nice place , and I know we will return to meet my sister - in - law from Chicago !!
Fast and affordable .
Great job master keying our building .
I did n't end up buying my car here , but I did think the guy who worked with me was pretty cool - he was willing to budge a little on the price which means a lot to me .
Also they will fill your tires with air and other small maintenance tasks for free , even if you did n't buy your car there !
They do n't seem to be interested in selling cars .
Went there yesterday : we are trying to decide between two different Honda models , so we wanted to test - drive both back to back .
The salesperson refused !
Claimed he was too busy for two test drives .
We were the only customers there !
Do n't waste time , just drive 10 minutes more down to Stevens Creek , they actually do try to help their customers there !
A thoroughly comprehensive service ; excellent communication and best of they are transparent with their fee ( ie nothing is simply implied or assumed ) .
HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FOOD
not only is this place too expensive for what it is , it s horrible !
In the past , I got a steak and there was more fat and rough pieces than there was good steak ( and this was the sirloin ! ) , the sides were drenched with butter and the salad was a little on the brown side .
Today we went for a party ( during lunch , so the place was empty ) with about 25 other people .
It took over 1.5 hours for our food to come out and by that time my 8 month old had it !
Does it seriously take that long for a soup and salad ?
I was a waitress for years and a key rule is to serve customers with small children before others , as I was the last to get my food .
I would NOT recommend having a party here or even going here .
Texas Roadhouse is WAY better !!
Great
This is a perfect place to get your hair done .
I have gone there time and time again whenever I need to get my hair done or when I want a haircut .
When I get my hair done there , they use enough hairstyling products while it does not ruin your hair .
The service is great and during weekends it tends to get busy , but the wait is worthwhile .
We love Little Farmer
We attend LFTD and our children LOVE it !!
They even want to go to school on the weekends !!
They are preparing my older son for kindergarten and looks forward to seeing his teacher and friends every day .
My infant is content every day when I drop off and pick up .
Great Doctor !
Dr. Faris is a great doctor !
I would recommend him to anyone .
I was experiencing severe back pain to the point I could barely walk or even bare to sit .
I went from a pain scale of 8 - 9 to 0 and I was able to run in the Crim just a week later !!
Holly is truely the best hairstylist !
I have lived in the UTC La Jolla area for many years , and I never new this salon was here until a friend reffered me to see Holly here .
I was very pleased with my experience here .
All of the people were friendly and welcoming .
I got highlights , haircut , and a blowdry .
She did a great job !
Holly is very experienced and talented , and I could tell she new what she was doing right off the bat .
My hair looks amazing , and I get compliments all the time .
I deffenitly reccomend this salon and Holly to anyone .
You will not be disappointed !!!!!!
We love our new roof !
We would like to thank you for the roofing job you did on our home .
Everything was done on a timely manner and things were cleaned and picked up every day when the crew was done .
We also liked the way that Ray checked on the job every day .
And when the job was done every thing was cleaned up and hauled off that same day .
We would not hesitate to use Spears Roofing again .
We have already recommended you to some of our friends !
They have good sushi for a good price .
My favorite so far in Bellevue .
Store is on the small side and atmosphere is just average .
great service / deals - support this local business
I have used these guys for new snows , fixing lots of flats , used replacement tires , and oil changes .
They have the best prices locally and good customer service .
One guy is a little surley , but who gives a crap as long as your car 's work is outstanding .
AND they 're usually able to help you as a walk - in , and they 're fast .
Overall - good stuff .
Real pros
I 've had writer friends describe horror stories with their printers .
I tell them : why not just go with these guys ?
Richard Joule and the gang are pros from start to finish .
They set out to exceed your expectations .
Already I 'm considering future projects , and I can assure you that for my printing needs I will be choosing no other than Atlanta Paperback Book Printing .
Signs of Saltford - an excellent supplier of value for money signs and banners etc .

Keep it up .
- Shree Ghatkopar Bhatia Mitra Mandal
Pleasure to work with .
The experience with every department has been great .
No complaints !
FAST and reasonable $
We went to Kobey s on Saturday and had our whole team s uniforms done !
He was less than half of the price of the cheapest quote we got , and his work was top notch .
Down to earth and fast service .
Going back to have some lab coats done this weekend !
Great out night !
You ca n't go wrong with Tuesday prices , even if you get quite the mixed bag of comedians !
Extensive drink list and daily specials but wish they had a bit more on their food menu , although popcorn is a nice touch !
( other items : chicken fingers , wings , asian pizza , and yam and regular fries )
amazing , fun , great beers .
service could be a little better but it s an all round good place
wonderful
I went to ohm after reading some of the reviews .
I go to school in the area and usually wait until I go home to get my hair cut .
I decided it was time to grow up and made an appointment .
Sierra was my stylist and i love what she did .
I have wavy hair and she cut to my hair style .
It was the first time i had left a salon with my hair curly .
Usually they blow dry it out and i have to wait until i wash it to see what it will look like in its natural state .
But she did a fabulous job letting me know what she was doing at all times and styled my hair in a way i could do it at home .
It was n't completly impossible !!!!
I am definitely going back
Over charged .
I used my card to purchase a meal on the menu and the total on my receipt was $ 8.95 but when I went on line to check my transaction it show $ 10.74 .
There is something wrong or maybe the individual made a mistake but to me that is not integrity .
Great service
These people were so helpful this week and did everything to sort out my windscreen and insurance .
It was all sorted with no hassle at all and I 'm really grateful - they were fab .
The best customer service I 've come across for long time .
NEVER fear going to the dentist again !
I 'm 61 years old and have dental problems my entire life .
By the age of 24 I stopped going to the dentist .
My fear and discomfort from dental work scared me !
It took all the courage I could muster to make an appointment .
At the front door of his office , I nearly turned around .
I considered just leaving after going inside and nearly did .
Doctor Gonzales and his entire staff are the most professional people I have ever dealt with .
They made me feel confident in what they would do , and treated me like a member of their own family .
I never felt pain or discomfort .
The ability to smile and eat again can only be described as a whole new lease on life .
Thank you Doctor Gonzales , Doctor Stout , Eva Marie and the entire staff !
They were very professional , respectful , completed the Job on time , and well below my budget .
I had a problem with the tile in my bathroom coming apart .
We have had nothing but compliments on our bathroom when guest come over - who would have guessed that one ?
I have been growing my hair out for 1 year plus and went in to get 1 inch taken off .
It was a great deal -- we paid a certain amount per person , and my husband and I chose 4 types of pizza and the servers brought out as much as we wanted .
Susanna is the best dress maker / tailor I 've ever come across in my whole life !
home team - thanks 4 playin !!!
as an example they took payment for 5 out of 6 monthly plan premiums for a yearly policy and cancelled the contract for the remainder of the policy for reasons they stated was not receiving information on other licensed drivers in the household ?
I felt as if I was in an over priced Olive Garden .
in my opinon this place should be shut down by the health inspector , and anyone who is satisfied with there service and food has never eaten at a real asian restaurant .
Not only were my wife and I very pleased , but I also had the air duct quality tested professionally by the home inspector that I regularly use , before and after United Air Duct performed their work .
I am sure this is a good place to stay from reading the other reviews , but if something unexpected happens in your life , they will not care .
In one of the emails I attached the letter from the Vet 's that expressed their sympathy , this hotel did nothing .
Marek Dzida the owner and photographer puts whole heart in his business - If you are into old fashion ( Not Digital ) quality photography this is best place in Long Beach as I think not many folks can do affordable traditional photos anymore I know Marek personaly and I will always recommend him
My friend called the hotel to cancel our room as soon as I called her .
Worst buffet period by far .
Mike one of owners was awesome , he explained the detailed plan , and executed on time , I am always going use them and refer them to many friends I can because of the great job they did me .
My friend and I were to stay here for a girls night , catch up on our lives evening .
We live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night .
Unfortunalty my husband and I had to put our 13 year old lab down that morning and we were not expecting this .
They said that we were to be charged for this room regardless because we did not cancel within the 72 hours .
I called them back a few hours after putting my Bodhi down and they still would n't budge .
Times are hard , I know , but they had no compassion .
I called 3 times to talked to a manager , never a call back .
I emailed 4 times , never a response .
I even emailed Mackinaw Tourist and nothing .
This insurance co. Is a joke !!!
They have absolutely no communication skills whatsoever .
if you do n't mind being robbed , cheated or lied to then this is the company for you .
They will make every attempt to misinform and misrepresent themselves .
They make up excuses in hopes to confuse their policy holders with misinformation .
I personally provided the request on four separate occasions and they claim there is a glitch in their systems ?
Home made product
I sometimes go into this store just for something to do on a sunday afternoon .
I love the people , the product and the service !
Nothing compares to a home made product that really stands the test of time . -
The Brick , Ikea , and Leon 's have their place .
But furniture like this will truly be around forever .
local crew !!!
the service is quick .
and the people are sweet :)
I was thoroughly impressed !
I called a few different businesses in the area to get estimates , they were n't the cheapest I found but very reasonable .
The best part is I got my whole bathroom remodeled for about the same price the other compan's were quoting just to fix the shower tile and fixtures .
They had the work done in about half the time quoted which made me and my wife extremely happy .
Very nice work and friendly guys too .
Best money I 've spent on remodeling ever .
I highly recommend any one considering home repair to give these guys a call .
Gets the Job Done
We have utilized Mr. Pozza and his firm twice now in our family and both times have been very pleased .
I would not hesitate to use him again or refer him to my family or friends .
Barb does an AMAZING JOB , she is always learning new things on how to use her hands and body , to give every person an AWESOME MASSAGE , CALL TODAY AND SCHEDULE YOU MUST SEE HER , YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE SHE IS THE BEST OF THE BEST !
As a very satisfied new customer , I wholeheartedly recommend United Air Duct Cleaning .
Great service
I had a dead battery last week and called this company since they were the closest they had very quick service for a Monday morning , thanks again guys .
Horrible
I walked out with 5 inch long hair on the top , 2 inch long hair on the sides , and 1.5 in the back .
My hair is uneven and it looks rediculous .
This woman should be working in supercuts ... if that .
This was a terrible experience and I hope that no one else goes through that .
Do your self a favor and do not go to this establishment .
PHOTOS DONE WELL
I Love Hellada Gallery !
Poor Taste
There is no lower rating for Noonan 's Liquor , owners and employees .
A negative number is not available .
CLH
Absolutely amazing job !
She makes every item fit you perfectly .
She is always so busy , too , which is a good indication of her talent .
She 's the best !
they recovered the pics geeksquad deleted .
many thanks
A very nice park .
The architecture is simplz splendid .
$ 9.62 excluding tip with water to drink for the buffet .
I want my money back !
slow service
I used to take my cars there all the time , but management changes hands too frequently , the service has been slow , and they often try to " add on " extra services , which sometimes is not needed .
I do nt go there anymore
Dentist you can trust
If possible I try the services on myself before I bring in my son .
Drs. Ali work wonders .
Neither me nor my son have n't had a single cavity since we started dental care there .
The team focus is prevention and education .
That alone makes them unique .
A very satisfied new customer !
They are professional , knowledgeable , and take meticulous care and pride in accomplishing their work .
Based on the test results , the home inspector stated that the quality of their job was " excellent " .
Dr. Shady
Kelly hit the nail on the head .
" Dr. Shady " is a jerk .
After the way she spoke to me on my last visit , I will not be returning !!
Good luck keeping business with that stuck up attitude Dr. Shady .
You have just lost mine .
The next time you feel like being condescending to someone , it is not going to be me !!!!!!
Dr. Shady is inexperienced and prideful .
She probably does not even have 10 % of the knowledge that some of the other EXPERIENCED vets do in this area .
I will be carefully researching vets before I take my dog someplace else .
Beautifully written reviews Doctor , but completely UNTRUE .
i had to call back up there two hours later and the lady ( who claimed to be a manager ) said my food was on the way , and she did nt offer to compensate me in any kind of way .
If this is the best that Tucson has to offer , I am out ta here ...
The staff was very helpful and gave me exactly what I needed for my first time ballerina .
the food was horrible not cooked like it should be , they got the order wrong on a number of occasions , and once forgot about my order .
Even though we were only supposed to have those specific types of pizza , when guests asked for a different type , it was brought out with no charge to us !
Are you kidding me ?
Excellent service , Not only did they get the exact car I wanted win in 48 hours but the sales man also took me out to lunch .
Highly recommended
My 8 year old daughter loves this place .
The best climbing club around .
The moving company is actualy based in Brooklyn , but advertised all over NY / NJ , including Fort Lee .
When the guys arrived ( 2 hours later than agreed ) they told that you have to pay all the tolls they payed coming from Brooklyn and extra $ 100 for them to drive back from your destination .
That was not in agreement eather , but they realy demand it .
So totalling $ 212 just for start before any work started .
Guess what , was not in the initial agreement as well .
I was moving out from 2 bdr apartment and it took for 3 strong guys 6 hours to load a track ( from 2 pm - 8 pm ) .
The only reason I 'm giving 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 , I should admit , nothing was broken .
So I still can recomend them but prepare pay twice as much as they tell you initially .
One more thing , they do n't take any credit cards or checks .
You have to pay CASH ONLY before they start unloading track on your destination .
There is no delivery .
There is no delivery .
This is one of the worst places I have stayed , we cut out stay short and went to the Mulberry .
Even though they still charge you the days you booked but wo n't use , it is worth the get the hell out of this crap hole .
Bad service starting from the front desk .
The best person is the valet .
Great job !
Mercedes and Dan are very thorough and on top of everything !
HORRIBLE
This school is the worst one i 've ever been to .
There 's holes everywhere in the ceiling , sewage constantly leaks through the ceiling , and the whole condition of the school is horrible .
The staff and the Principal are rediculous , they do n't listen to any input , and they make up rediculous rules ( They banned backpacks , because a teacher TRIPPED OVER a student 's ) .
The education is horrible at best , do society a favor , and do NOT send your student here .
Fresh and unic !
Very professional , talented , unic and fresh work .
Paula has an amazing gift for creativity , vision and the ability to combine art to / with commercial purpose .
Bravo !
The BEST
Dr. Aster and her team have been a strong advocate in the health of both my daughters .
Dr. Aster is very kind an gentle with the children , but also positive and to the point with the parents .
She is and excellent doctor to have on one 's team .
Friendly service .
Attentive to the needs of customer .
Thanks again !
I heard the libido band play live and they are out of site !!
Quick to take money but not quick to fix a problem !
B&B came out very quickly to give us our quote back in June .
They were very polite , eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence .
Our fence was installed quickly in August and they had their money and left saying " Workmanship is guaranteed for a year ! " .
We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of .
We heard nothing .
We then called the office and the man we spoke to said he 'd send someone out to look at it but could n't promise when - two weeks came and went and we heard nothing .
I just called again and was told that workmanship , not wood , is guaranteed for a year - well in my opinion - the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship !
YES !
I 'm very frustrated at this point - it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked ( the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through ) yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once WAS a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer .
So I figure if they do n't want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then I 'll take the time to let everyone I can know about how they treat customers once they have your money !!!
STAY AWAY !!!
YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR !!!
When the fence was first installed I would have given them five stars , now for their poor customer follow - up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one - star in my opinion !
Good and Bad
I had to take care of the ants myself .
But I found the location wonderful and the neighbors very kind .
Never had a problem with the staff and found them very helpful when something went wrong .
Because of the ants I dropped them to a 3 star .
Our family has been trusting Doctor Hank with our teeth for the last seven years .
Everyone on staff is very professional and friendly .
Loved the pool and BBQ .
Disatisfied customer , I went through Kitchen Aid and used one of their recommended vendors .
Their quote came in at half the price of A&E for the same work and same part .
Since I 'm usually at work late Deb has stayed around to help me out when needed .
Each of you should be proud of your massive contributions throughout the year !
I knew I had found the real deal , big pies , sold by the slice , with the pizzas sitting under the glass in the front .
We had no choice but to stay but will take this as far as we can .
When we walked in , the person behind desk said : " oh well , you must wait , I am in the middle of something . "
Somewhere in between his rudeness he asked if we smoked .
I explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at 5 am , but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gon na lock the doors right at 5:30 .
I 've read some of the reviews below and would like to state that yes , like any other doctor s office there is sometimes a wait ( depending on what other patients are being seen for ) and some of the tests and procedures that are ran can be costly ( just like they would be for any other medical tests elsewhere if you do not have insurance ) ...
I have seen several of the providers from the office and have not once been shown anything but care and consideration .
For $ 4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler .
I called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up , they got my order confused with someone else s .
It is the attention to detail and the quality of the work taught at TomiPilates that sets this studio apart from the others .
The team at Bradley Chevron kept my car running for well past its expected death !
They are honest about ' immediate ' concerns versus ' recommended ' repairs and have very fair prices .
I hate to say check them out just for the salsa , but James , I NEED another jar badly :) All kidding aside , they are a very good company , I have a hard time giving any service biz a 5 star review but they came close .
The apartment across from mine belonged to a gang of hookers .
They told me that this is not under warranty and want to charge me $ 175 just to diagnose the problem !
Seems like all they care about is the money and getting home on time , NO care for the customers AT ALL !!!
While there was n't too much available for their age ( ball pit , bouncy area and a little padded pyramid to climb on ) , we went right when they opened at 10 am on a winter weekday and ended up being the only ones there , so we were given a little more liberty than we would have if others had been there .
We were standing in the store for 20 minutes to simply pick up an order .
Tried Crust on Broad on 3 occasions .
It is the real thing - I have been practicing Pilates for over 7 years and would not go anywhere else .
I called on a Friday at 12:30 complaining of a severe toothache .
Dr. Obina told me that his office closed at noon and that I should call him on Monday .
I had been a patient of Dr. Olbina for 9 years and had spent thousands of dollars on crowns etc .
This can tend to be a stressful experience in itself let alone adding crossing boarders for the first time .
I have been going to Warner Family for a number of years and would highly recommend it to anyone .
Cathy ****** Five Stars for Lake Forest Tots .
The program has been a postive experience for my children .
I needed a part for my appliance , the cost was very high so I said never mind , paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote .
Very disappointed in Kitchen Aid as well , I thought that they pre-screened their vendors for price and quality of work , obviously they do not !
I congratulated this establishment for doing the research on making NYC pizza because these Scots fcking nailed it .
it was a little to high dollar for me
Anyone else find it a little suspicious that there are not only 20 reviews for this dentist ( a HUGE number compared to the others in the area ) , but that they all have the same unique grammar structure ?
45 p for tap water !
Clean rooms , great for the price and cheapest on the exit .
Thanks for the great care !!!!
I ca nt speak for them but any tests or appointments they recommend are probably in the best interests of us ( the patient ) and you have the ability to decline anything that they suggest to you .
I personally have had wonderful service and if you re truely looking for a FAMILY practice ... Warner Family is the place for you .
She asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead .
You have to bring in your own models and they have to pay for you to use them if you do nt then you can graduate !
The staff will not even answer the phone for take out .
Great meats that are already cooked , easy to take home for dinner .
And the salsa , be sure to ask for a jar and have plenty of chips around , you will need them .....
Parking spaces are just big enough for a Mini Cooper .
Thank you again for great customer service !
Now that I live here , this is my favorite place to grab flowers for friends and coworkers !
Nothing too much trouble for Ian , thanks for a great stay .
Please pass my appreciation to the Staff and Management for their excellent hospitality and good spirits as it helped make a stressful trip enjoyable .
I work for a large retail company recently expanding our operations into Canada and had to travel to ensure all of our computer network equipment was installed properly and on time .
Pretty spendy for really not great quality
The other guy was pulled over one day and a cop saw suspicious papers with names and social security numbers on it .
From the amount of time spent with us to explain things during the initial quote , to the communication through the approval process to the actual workmanship of the build itself .
The manager - Tiffany - is actually very nice so I 'm a bit surprised by other comments .
They helped about three other people before they offered to help me again .
We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible .
This place is identical to the Youngstown Sports Grille , so I imagine they are owned / operated by the same people .
It clearly had been prepared from fresh ingredients .
Definitely not going to purchase a car from here .
We order take out from here all the time and we are never disappointed .
These guys took Customer Service 101 from a Neanderthal .
And from a place that specializes in high quality meat , too .
Myself and my fiance 's identity was stolen from the office staff .
Yes the parking can be a challenge but being from NJ I am no stranger to tight corners .
Not to mention that the wait staff was about as pleasant as dealing with an angry bull .
This is by far the worst chinese food I have ever had .
I do nt know how it is possible to make orange chicken , sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puffs taste THAT bad but China Delight accomplished that .
Jason and the boys can do about anything you need .
Choose this hotel over the Hilton ( which is on the next block ) .
Such a convenient location as well with coffee shop and bradley food and beverage right around corner .
The employees make you feel very comfortable and are very helpful , whether you are very knowledgeable or do n't know anything at all about wine .
Do n't even get me started on how expensive it is to drink there .
I completely enjoyed my whole check in experience and was impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff as well as the accommodations themselves .
The second vendor charged $ 55 ( less than half of what A&E charges ) to come and applied that to the price of the repair service ( which A&E does not ) .
Seems to me like A&E charges way more than necessary !
They also got my friend s order mixed up and wanted to charger her $ 10 more than what she had wanted .
They have a great selection of wine from all over the world with all different prices .
Instead of rescheduling they chose to waste my time instead .
The Worst Chinese I 've Ever Had
The service stunk .
They were abrasive and rude - when they were the ones who messed everything up .
The only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and the vegetable lo mein was barely tolerable .
I will NEVER go here again .
Lucky Panda in Willis is a billion times better in service and quality of the meal .
I have no idea how China Delight won number 1 Chinese restaurant in Montgomery - There needs to be a recount on that vote .
Rude and Untrustworthy
They are especially rude to women .
Do not trust them !
College is a Joke and the Salon is a JOKE !
Went to the school here OVER PRICED !!!!!!
You do NOT learn the things you were promised .
Staff is under educated .
Over priced for students to learn !
Beware of the nail program you are not taught to use a nail drill AT ALL you learn the old fashioned way of doing nails you will not be able to do well in a salon !!!
BEWARE !
Overpriced
The food is mediocre at best , and largely overpriced given the portion size and quality .
I have ate here 3 times since they first opened , and the service has been poor each time , the staff always comes across as somewhat rude and slow .
My favorite florist !
I came to La Crosse to go to college , and my mom would send me birthday flowers though here .
They were beautiful and lasted forever !
Hands down , best place in the area !
There are plenty of good dentists in Fernandina .
Do n't go to Amelia Gentle Dentistry .
She continues to help me when needed even if I have a service question .
Service does not get any better !!!!
How a pizza place should be !
+ there is a free cola with every pizza .
I have had all three of my children attend Lake Forest Tots .
The program is well established and we have been extremely satisfied with the teachers , the programs and the director .
Good job , Lake Forest Tots !
A&E came out , charged $ 129 fee just to walk in the door .
GREAT SERVICE AND PEOPLE !!
Deb Watson is the contact person and she and the rest of the staff were great !!!
We just got our sunroom built by Patio World and can say that I 'm extremely happy with the whole thing .
I have nothing bad to say .
Very glad that we went with them .
Amazing service !
I just had the best experience at this Kal Tire location .
Courteous , fast and friendly .
Rip Off !
Ridiculous !
Avoid !
The front desk staff was very pleasant and efficient .
Serves FREE breakfast !
Fresh and Excellent Quality
The food is always fresh and delicious .
This was after I brought the car !!!! !
Well then I went on a trip to Glasgow and was walking around .
Do n't think I 've ever been charged before .
Oh , and salad cream , not mayonnaise , on the coleslaw .
It can be a little on the spicy side but just ask them exactly what you want and they are very helpful .
After a good few minutes , he asked : " what do you want ? "
Going back after graduating you r told you get a discount on services nope you do nt .
Going there you learn the school does not care about the services given just about the money .
Twice for dinner and once for lunch Absolutely rude service every time !
Quality has fallen over the years , but still the best go - to burger place on the East Bay .
They sent over someone who said he knows nothing about curtains and could not show me fabric options or give an estimate .
We were told by a detective and asked to check our credit for anything unusual .
Luckily they caught the crooks before they did one on us .
Horrible Service !
I got yelled at , literally yelled at because i asked if i could pick up my car 5 - 10 minutes late .
Rude , unprofessional , just jerks .
Missed a whole day of work because i am now carless .
I will NEEEEEEEEEVERRRR go to this place again .
highly recommended .
Tonight , I called several times with no answer ( Btwn 5:30 and 6 pm ) and finally drove there to place my order in person .
There was not a customer to be found .
Pure Pilates !!
The teachers are highly trained and are expert at handling all types of clients .
No Customer Service
Employees seemed to be having a good time chatting and laughing with each other , while myself and other customers were completely ignored .
Another person in the store stood there with an item and repeatedly tried to get a sales person s attention .
It was n't until he gave up and walked out the door that someone asked Can I help you .
Good local bike shop
Good local bike shop .
The shop is located just off the river road .
recommended
Excellent location .
Good sports bar .
Hyatt web site improved .
Accurate check - out .
Rooms clean .
Lifts quick , clean , accurate , and correctly sized .
A +
Excellent customer service and honest feedback .
I gave Dr. Rohatgi 2 stars because her assistant was very pleasant .
However , I did not find her very helpful and her receptionist was rude .
Perfect Location plus
I moved into the Tanglewood Apartments in late 2008 and it 's been a refreshing change .
I used to live at Meadowrun and that was a nightmare .
She 's very reachable and she has always responded quickly to any questions or requests .
Plus she plans a monthly breakfasts and other events at the clubhouse which is a nice added benefit .
Old time grocery , best steaks I have ever had !
Pam the Pom
Fantastic couple of days .
Breathtaking views and fabulous accommodation .
Sure enough he charged it to the credit card .
Ok I am a New Yorker who has been going to school in Oxford , England .
this is the worst Sam s club I 've ever been to
After my trees were cleaned up , they gave me a jar of salsa .
Anna Marie and Govind are very sweet people , and the minute you steep into their school , the calm loving atmosphere takes over , and tension and worries stay outside in the street , whether or not you pick them up again after class is probably a question of practice .
I will be traveling in this area in the future and you can be assured that this experience will be helpful in my choice of hotels and Novotel will be my first selection .
I came to find out the person was the hotel OWNER also .
If I found a spot , I could nt fit in it .
Very affordable ( do n't call it cheap ) and their trimmers were quick and courteous when I got home from work .
We have never had a bad experience buying from Edmark .
I purchased a 2 - year old certified pre-owned BMW from this dealership .
( But this is a certified car from a dealer . )
From my first encounter at check in to my regrettable check out I found the staff and facility to exceed my expectation .
Buyer Beware !!
$ 400 later my jaw dropped when the receptionist told me the total .
I cried the entire way home .
He then " fixed " it for free but it still looked like crap .
I will never go back .
Maybe he did n't do a good job and they told him so .
Absolute Nightmare !
Great Job
I 'm sure it s not every day that a funeral director sees the same family in such a short time .
The Peterson Family
The best in the area !
I am very pleased with the tattoos that I revived from them .
The artwork is excellent and the prices are very reasonable .
I would recommend this shop to anyone looking to get a tattoo .
I have been going to the Wildwood , NJ for over 30 years for summer vacations and always call the Madrid first .
I rated it 5 stars .
I am not saying it is a 5 star hotel .
It is the hospitality from Tom and staff , that makes it feel like a 5 star hotel in the middle of the beach .
We prefer the layout of rooms and it is always clean .
Excellent Driving School
Unfortunately , a family emergency required me to conquer this fear .
She highly recommended him and described him as the " Saintly Instructor and Simply the Best Instructor there is .... very calm , pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions " .
I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson .
Hopefully they spice things up or they wo nt be in business long .
I recommend La Hacienda
Extremely bad customer service
Rude , insensitive , discourteous people !!!!!
That said , I hated this restaurant .
Personally I recommend you take your money elsewhere
Great store great products
Great Service
Dr Mcdonald is wonderful .
She answers all questions asked and provides the best service i have ever seen .
I have a new born daughter and she helped me with a lot .
Good Job DR .
Be Careful Of Who Your Sales Guy Is
My experience was awful though .
I was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it , but the sales guy I dealt with ruined the deal .
Essentially , I told him I did n't trust him cause he was a car salesman , but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back .
After that , I just tried to ignore his lack of professionalism and test drive the car .
Highly recommended .
Joe removed a wasp nest for our condominium building and we appreciated the environmentally friendly method and prompt , friendly and informative service .
No spraying of pesticides !
Very professional .
Reasonable rate .
We highly recommend Joe and his wasp removal service to individual home owners and condos .
He knows his bees !
Suzanne , Vancouver
Best in Memphis
I have a Saab ... which everything is expensive on and they have been extrememly fair and price a lot lower than any other shop I called .
They are the only place I would take my car peiod .
They were very professional , neat and clean .
They came through on all of their promises and we had a very successful day .
I will be using Bridies again .
nice friendly local bagel place
there might be bigger and more well known bagel places in the area but Family Bagels are nice people , small shop and incredibly friendly .
While other may be ok waiting in line at Town Bagel we are happy with the quality and service we get at Family Bagels
They 've always been timely and inexpensive .
My girlfriend and I took a chance on this place because we did n't want to wait in line at Outback .
What an amazing find - this restaurant is a GEM .
# 1 it s immaculately clean .
This is authentic Cuban cuisine ; fresh ingredients expertly prepared and seasoned perfectly .
TRY THIS PLACE - YOU 'LL LOVE IT .
Good Service - Limited Results
He was willing to talk to me about my specific issues and develop a plan of action .
The down side was that sometimes there was a lot of noise in the hallway from other patients / doctors .
The sessions were nice and I felt relaxed after them but did not notice any changes with my cycles .
I know it can take a while for results and did n't expect a miracle , but after 2 months I felt like it was not entirely worth the cost / time .
Great Cookies , Cakes , and Customer Service
Although I 'll have to drive a little out of my way to go there , I 'll gladly do it knowing that since she 's been astounding to me once before that she 'll always be that way !
( Also she has a really great website !
She deserves many 5 star reviews !!
Ham s on Friendly ... RIP
This is the original Ham 's restaurant , expanded into a regional chain in the late 80's -- but this one is no more .
Victim of hard times and I suspect failing corporate management .
According to news accounts , the company is struggling .
I have many fond memories of my college evenings there long ago .
So long Ham s ... you will be missed .
Absolutely the best little motel on the coast !
I 've stayed at this fabulous little motel two years running , and I have to say it 's one of the best lodging experiences I 've ever had on the coast ... and I 'm even comparing it to the big resorts I 've stayed at !
The rooms are SO clean , the managers / owners are the nicest people , the place feels so homey , and the location and grounds are beautiful .
The motel is very well maintained , and the managers are so accomodating , it 's kind of like visiting family each year ! ;-)
I honestly ca n't rave enough about this place ... it 's really a hidden gem worth checking out !
Outdated but not bad
So I really felt like this place was extremely outdated especially since the pictures make it look nice and modern .
It had listed that there was a hot breakfast but all this meant is that they added a waffle maker to the common continental affair at most cheap hotels .
Great Sanwiches , Great Prices
I used to go here almost every day since I work in the neighbourhood and loved their turkey and meatball sandwiches .
Chicken salad salad is great too .
Best of all , the staff is quick on their feet and even with long lines , usually serve you in 5 minutes or less .
For the quality , the prices ( $ 4 - $ 6 ) have to be the best in town .
The staff get to know regulars and do their job very well .
This is n't a TGIF or Cafe , it s a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that .
Summary : Not cheep , but very fast , and super friendly service .
Quality of work is sufficient but not outstanding .
Like all oil place changes , ask / recommend the 100 other services they have .
Will be a repeat customer with discount coupons .
Finest ??
Really ??
I beg to differ .
This place is marginal at best .
Not very welcoming and focused mostly on keeping little kids entertained .
I was not impressed , and quite frustrated at their lack of rating for their courses .
I understand not wanting to put labels like 5.10 on an indoor course , because yes , it is not the same , but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when you are an intermediate climber looking to improve .
Rate the routes , with understandable markings and a more detailed system than easy , moderate , and hard .
Class act .
It was late in the day and I was worried I would get charged an arm and a leg and have to wait forever .
Would do business with them again .
Trust The Midas Touch
This is however a very busy shop but there are appointments available & the staff up front will surely make sure you get back in a timely manner .
I look at some of these other comments & laugh because people think that the world revolves around them !
Like the girl with the fuse problem ...
Midas has the most high tech equipment in town & I guarantee you if they told you it was electrical then in deed it s electrical !
maybe you should understand how the world works & realize you are just like any other person & not put yourself on a pedestal .
I will continue going to Dave at Midas because he is one of the most honest business owners in this town !
Very unhappy ...
Working with Rod Jacobsen was my first experience working with a CPA , so I did not know what to expect .
That said - he seemed to be doing well enough .
However , then I asked to amend my return to apply a credit I had just become eligible for .
Well , that was strike one .
Last year , after all was said and done , I asked Rod whether my payment structure would leave me with no / little tax liability at the end of the year .
He said yes .
Well , again , I am now faced with a tax bill of $ 6,000 + , all due on April 15 , 2010 and all that Rod has to say to the matter is ' well , you wo n't have to pay a penalty . '
I may not have to pay a penalty , yet , but this is NOT what I had in mind when hired these guys .
In the words of my new accountant , THEY LET ME DOWN !
Not what i expected !
We read the good reviews before going and had high hopes .. but to our dismay it did nt turn out that way !
Scallops were overcooked and the foie gras was cold but the rest of the food was lovely .
Top notch eats !
So here we are in Manson .
Manson ?
Yes , Manson .
Aka Nowheresville .
And this litttle gem of a 7 - table restaurant is a complete and utterly wonderful surprise .
A short but wide - ranging menu executed with innovative perfection in a cozy hole in the wall just off the main street .
Fantastic food served without pretense , very reasonably priced wine selections .
A great place to go for dinner after a day of wine tasting .
happy customer
Mr. Squeege is THE BEST .
Prompt , Clean Windows .
Affordable pricing .
Friendly responses .
How else can excellent be described for a business of this sort ?
You will find the same to be true for you .
AMAZING
Absoul is the greatest donair man on the planet .
Highly recommended .
If you enjoy amazing things , you must go to World 's Finest Donair .
Lest you be lame !!!
I give this place 11 / 10 .
3 thumbs up .
Bon appetit !
Craft Wonderland with History
My first visit was so fun yesterday .
I could have stayed all day and not seen all the things .
I am doing origami jewelry and found exactly the right things for earrings and got many other ideas there too .
I bought a beginner s quilling set and like making the filigree forms you can make and add to other crafts .
The owner , Jean , has been there 31 years !
What a history .
She is a super sweet , lovable and well - informed woman with a great sense of humor .
This store is a real gem and has much to offer the serious crafter or the occasional crafter .
Great name for a great store !
Shop Local !

Fantastic Nova Scotia Cottage
We had a fantastic time .
Such a relaxing atmosphere and inspiring architecture .
Sand Hill park was a great beach ...
Nice warm water .
Thank - You for sharing your cottage !
WONDERFUL service .
I have used them once and will use them in the future .
Beautiful work , fast shipping and great communication .
Do n't bother .
It 's impossible to understand how this place has survived .
DO Nt Go here
Great work and honest establishment !
I had tried out few place around the area and had been ripped off a few times .
I had hear great things about Phet and G&G Automotive so I decided to give him a try .
The service was excellent and personable .
He checked out what I needed to have done told me what needed be fixed before he did any work and did great repair work .
The price was actually lower than what I had anticipated and used to compared to other places , plus he showed me the work he did when I came in to pick up the car .
Also , a week after the work , Phet called me up to see how my car was running and to let me know that they had accidentally overcharged me for part of the work and wanted to give me a refund for that amount .
That is just unheard of these days !
Friendly , clean and excellent location
The staff was very helpful , and gave us good advice on day and night time activities .
Common room was comfortable and clean , very good room to read or relax . -
A great breakfast which was included every morning until 9:30 am ; yummy fresh Parisian croissants .
The location is really stellar !
It is close to bus lines for Opera Plaza , Galleries Lafayette , and the famous flea Market .
We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay at the Vintage Hostel again .
Rocky M. Lange Retired Coordinator , Clark County School District
what a mind blowing servicing
They treat there employees with respect and concern and expect that they will extend the same politeness to there customers .
best place for snowboard eva .
Prominent Builders NJ
Prominent Builders in New Jersey are one the best building contractors , I was referred to them by my friend , I am so glad I used them for my Home renovation , and addition .
Good food and coffee with a nice atmosphere
Wonderful service for large group
I had my wedding luncheon at this BJ s restaurant , and it was one of the best choices that I made .
We were also served salad and soda .
We had a large party , about fifty people or so , and yet everything was served quickly and we all had a wonderful time .
I really appreciate BJ s for making that special day even better with their wonderful food and service .
The finest German bedding and linens store .
Quality and service come first here .
Wonderful Atmosphere
I have been going there since I was a little girl and love the friendly and relaxing atmosphere .
Dr. Stiefvater has always been very professional and helpful .
I would recommend Bayside Chiropractic to anyone who is in need of a regular adjustment or is suffering from a chronic condition .
This is not your usual cheap hotdog place .
They offer a large variety of quality hotdogs and hamburgers They also offer veggie dogs .
The fries are of good quality , the staff is friendly .
The atmosphere is your typical indie outfit with old movie posters and memorabilia from the 70's and 80's .
Close to my house , this is the only reason I would go to this particular QT .
Not so good
Not worth the money .
Bland and over cooked .
I was hoping to have found a regular place to eat .
But not so .
First Time Ballerina
My daughter is starting ballet this year for the first time .
I 'm a soccer mom so I was n't sure what I was looking for when it comes to dancewear .
The service at Instep was great !!
I would recommend them to anyone !
One of the worst places
This place and its sister store Peking Garden are the worst places to order from .
i waited another 30 mins before receiving my food and it was cold .
beware they will rip u off
I do n't get it .
Spongy and sweet bread ( microwaved ? ) , heartless salsa , tiny dogs ...
You order at the counter and there is a space for tip on your credit card receipt .
The dude who grills the retarded dogs is rude .
Easiest Time I ever had purchasing a car !
Very kind and reliable .
I highly recommend this dealership if you would not like to hassle on price and receive friendly service .
I have since purchased two cars from this dealership , The first one was from Phillip and the second was from Richard .
Both were excellent sales men who put my needs first .
Con Garage
I brought my car in for a simple emissions test .
I guess they figured me for an easy mark , and tried to explain that my car would n't pass unless I replaced a hose .
Ten minutes later , I took my car down the street and it passed the emissions test with flying colors .
If you 're a fan of herpes , being ripped off , and child molesters , this is the garage for you .
If not , go somewhere else .
Fantastic fresh food !
What a neat gem of a restaurant in a corner one would n't expect it .
Cozy , warm atmosphere , great service .
Most importantly , the food was outstanding .
We 'll be back often .

FANFUCKINGTASTIC
I thought the UK was completely devoid of good NYC style pizza .
I thought to get a decent pizza the only way was at a fancy restaurant , and I have to get a whole pie .
I thought I would have to wait until I went home to NYC .
I saw this place and it looked like the HOLY GRAIL .
They have crushed red pepper flakes and oregano .
So I ordered a slice .
It tasted like I just flew back home .
I du n no how they did it , but Scottish friends --- this is THE REAL DEAL .
That being said , I do n't know how their delivery service is .
They might want to change the name to reflect the new yorkedness of the pizza , scrummy yummy sounds gimmicky to me .
A wonderful place , if you want more than just the physical side of yoga .
Give yourself the gift of trying this place , to see if it fits you ...
They are out of business .
Nice people ... I hear .
Calls are now forwarded to Malcolm Smith Motorsports down the road .
And they seem to be posted at fairly regular intervals ?
Horrible .
Horrible .
I asked if this hotel had smoking rooms .
He immediately said " no , there is a $ 50 deposit now ! "
When I inquired he rudely replied " in the morning when things are checked out you 'll get it back . "
I called customer service about it because the website specifically states that there are no other charges at the check - in .
I also mentioned to the reception person .
He responded " we have problem with ' people ' " .
Imagine a hotel having problems with people .
I finally alerted him to his rudeness .
He said he 's had a long and bad day .
Do n't stay there .
Yeah they ruined some shirts I had too .
Horrible !
Excellent medical care !!!!!!
Highly recommend
I went to this urgent care center and was blown away with their service .
Finally a convenient place close to home .
Wonderful staff and physician .
Clean and superb .
Will definitely go back when I need medical care .
ok
ca n't remember good or bad , so it must have been meh .
A friend and I recently took our 16 and 18 month olds here .
It 's not the classiest place , but it was cleaner than I expected and the staff was very friendly .
Rooms were outdated , dirty , and small .
Service was horrible .
Go down 1 block to Super 8 .
Skylight repair
My skylight was making a horrible noise when the wind blew .
James Bateman came the day I called and fixed the problem quickly and efficiently .
He also inspected my entie roof to see if there was anything else that needed attention .
He called the next day to see if everything was to my satisfaction .
When the next hailstorm blows through , I will not hesitate to contact James at Team Texas Construction .
Great gym and great services .
Midtown Reston has great location and luxurious environment .
Really enjoyed it .
Great Wine & Service
This place is so great !
Check out their wine tastings every Friday night !
Terrible service !!!
Made an appointment to have them come to the house to discuss curtain options and give an estimate .
When I called the manager to complain , she said she KNEW the guy did n't know about curtains and that the usual lady called in sick hours earlier !
So what was the point of the appointment !?!
To just come over and hang out ?!?
I will NEVER do business with this company !
EVER !!!
WHAT A GREAT DEAL THANK YOU
One of the better vegetarian sandwiches I 've had in Seattle .
Best Salsa ( hehehe )
The owner warned me that it was the best salsa I would ever had , and he was right .
No joke !
Identity Theft
It was a black female that use to work in the office .
She stole the information and gave it to another guy that did all the work .
That s how they were caught .
They both went to jail and a new manager was put in charge of the apartments .
Nobody lived there .
A girl would show up , then a guy in a nice car would show up .
Short time later the guy would leave , then the girl .
My apartment was usually quiet .
I lived in one that did not face the parking lot .
It sucked having an SUV .
Gates worked 30 % of the time at best .
Bugs were a small problem , nothing too bad .
Fantastic Place to buy your next vehicle
This is car number 3 we 've purchased through them .
We trust and appreciate Scott Larson and know that he will always take good care of us and listen to our needs !
The night I drove back home , I found that the rear window has some leakage .
( You can hear the wind while driving on highway .
Very likely it needs a new window seal ) .
I admit that I should have paid attention to this kind of little things while test drive .
So I brought the car back the second day .
Who knows how much they want me to pay to fix this thing .
I walked away .
So my advice is that NEVER TRUST THIS DEALER .
STAY AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE .
First trip to Canada
I recently traveled to Canada on business and had a most excellent experience .
I was very pleased to find my accommodations and the hotel staff to be a very calming and comforting part of my trip .
I found the hotel to be amazingly clean , not to mention very well adorned with many pleasant surprises .
great tmobile service
I was with verizon and I checked my service with tmobile and it was great so I thought I would try tmobile .
It turned out being very good quality tmobile service and I was happy with the new tmobile phone .
Too many kids , too many knifings , too many taserings .
Extremely greasy .
Hit or miss on the service .
My fries were n't fully cooked last time I went there .
A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE !
I remain unhappy .
I still have noticeable scarring .
I still have surgically induced hair loss .
My results were just AWFUL .
My post-op treatment was TERRIBLE .
I would n't recommend this place last year , and I certainly would n't recommend them this year .
Excellent customer service and quality work .
They went the extra mile to repair my cowboy boots -- they had to have a special kind of paper that looked like wood grain to fix the heels .
That was 4 years ago .
I have n't been able to find a shoe repair place in Seattle since that has been able to do it .
If I had time to drive to Tacoma before they closed during the work week , I would just so I could get those boots fixed properly again .
Awesome !!!!
But i paid $ 100 .
3 Days For get that ...
Great service .
I would recommend them to anyone ..
Dumbest F'ers ever
I called dominos tonight , it rang forever , I get put on hold twice without saying a word and FINALLY someone says , MAY I HELP YOU ?
They say no , Warwick in New Jersey , Call New Jersey .
I laugh and say , no , that Warwick is in New York , but I 'm at the Radison - Warwick .
And he says : You 're at Warwick in Pennsylvania ?
and I said , YES , CENTER CITY PHILLY , and he says , NO , Warwick is a township , If you 're at a Radison in Warwick that s too far , try dominos in Pottstown .
I say , NO , I am at the RADISON WARWICK HOTEL in Rittenhouse Square .
He says : I not know that town , I have to get to work , I 'm in PHILLY .
Call dominos in your town .
He says , I have to have an exact ADDRESS .
OK , 1701 LOCUST STREET i say .
he says : Why you tell me you r in WARWICK TOWNSHIP ?
Would not recommend I Was in a fair amount of pain for several weeks .
his clinic is very very dirty he is a real disaster to go totally not organized for every step he take .
Is not a service office
This is a delivery office only and does not take walk ins but they do have a blue box out front .
Glad I called before I arrived with my box to ship .
Thought adding a comment would save someone the hassle with a useless trip there .
this is a good place
I have been here before and the service was absoulutely great .
i reccomend you to go and enjoy their wonderful hospitality .
Great pet care
I have used Just Like Family several times now and they have provided great care for my two dogs .
Lynda is professional and has great compassion for animals .
The real testament is not in how much she likes your animals but how much they like her .
I highly recommend her .
