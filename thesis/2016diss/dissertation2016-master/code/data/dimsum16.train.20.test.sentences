Do we need another one ?
Only if it is of the quality of That 's Amore .
The menu has the usual but then they step it up another notch .
The arancini di riso ( risotto fritters ) are not to be missed .
Chicken saltimboca was excellent and then there 's the chocolate mousse that comes straight from heaven .
Pay extra attention to the appetizers - the next time I go there I 'm planning on ordered a few instead of an entree .
This is a great place to get a permit
I had to get a permit here , it was cool
Great lunch specials .
Delivery is lightning fast .
Perfect since I 'm on a budget .
But otherwise , it can feel pricey for what you get .
Like the sushi , do n't like the pad thai .
A good cut !
Cecile is a hairdresser and has just moved into the neighbourhood .
I go to see her to have my hair cut .
Run for the hills ... you 'll be much better off !
One night was too much .
First room had used tissues next to the bed and I requested it be rectified .
I was then moved to another room around the back where the room was dirty , the shower was dirty with other people s hair in it , the toilet seat was peeling and rough and the bathroom was full of mould .
I called reception to ask if they knew the state the room was in and was told " This is a Days Inn , not the Hilton " and the receptionist then hung up on me .
To warn you to stay away from this place just is n't enough .
There was not one ounce of caring involved and anyone I can warn about the complete lack of service will be warned .
house closing
Mrs. Tolchin provided us with excellent service and came with a great deal of knowledge and professionalism !
Her flexibility and accessibility made for an easy closing .
An Asset to Richmond
For a long time , one big source of entertainment missing from the Richmond City Limits was a first - run multiplex .
Bowtie has filled that role nicely .
The theatre is in an old brick warehouse , which is a block away from the Flying Squirrels stadium .
The owners of Bowtie manged to add something new while preserving what was already there .
The theatre has greatly improved the surrounding neighborhood .
There 's plenty of parking , and I 've never had an issue with audience members who wo n't stop talking or answering their cellphones .
Best of all , there are no ads !!!! !
Just previews and the main feature .
Expect to pay full price , and the theatres themselves are on the small side .
But if you like going to the movies , you should love Bowtie .
The mangers also play a classic movies on Sundays , you can get a beer in the lobby , and repeat customers can get discounts if they have a member card .
A great cinema in a great location .
Thank you , Bowtie !
The finest Christmas Trees i 've ever seen .
I felt like I was in heaven when I walked through the majestic fields of this particular farm .
The trees were in magnificent shape and the variety was astounding .
The owners were entertaining and gracious .
I especially liked the Eco friendly atmosphere and the owner s love of all animals .
This is one of the best farms I have ever been too .
I would call it the Taj Mahal of the east coast !
It put hair on my chest and thanks to the owner s advice I invested vanguard , got myself a woman like Jerry , and became a republican .
Thanks Tussey Mountain Tree Plantation !
Excellent Pizza !!
It s the only pizza place I recommend in Woodland Hills .
Yum .
My wife and kids ca n't get enough .
Highly recommended .
OMG
OMG .. make sure to book a reservation , as this magical place is packed ( in a nice way ) I love that the owner walks around and cares how his customers feel about their food .
The waiters are like no other ...
My waiter was so excellent I gave him a 75 % tip , and it was worht every penny ..
The food was finger licking the bowel fantastic ..
I just discovered her has a place right near my work ( Color me Phat ) If you are looking for a romatic place with the best food and service in the valley Giovanni Ristorante should be your number 1 + 2 choice .
ATE HERE A COUPLE TIMES .
IT IS NOT A HIGH END STEAK HOUSE , MORE OF THE CUISINE BRETT ENJOYS IN MISSISSIPPI .
SO , IF YOU WANT A BURGER AND FRIES , WELL , IT IS OK .
IF YOU WANT A LITTLE CAJUNISH FOOD - IT IS GOOD .
IF YOU WANT A STEAK , WELL , THIS IS NOT THE BEST IN GREEN BAY .
OVERALL DECENT BUT IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A RUTH CHRIS TYPE STEAK , THIS IS NOT IT .
A Great Help !
Ashdown Horse Transport were fantastic !
Very friendly and ALWAY contactable even at weekends .
I would hesitate to recommend anyone .
Thanks again Nina .
PS. Love the new website !
Whatever you order , you will LOVE !
We have stayed at Tanglewood for many years now .
We go over about 5 times a year .
We have never had a problem with the cabins .
They are always so helpful .
The cabins have always been clean .
Helen is a wonderful place to take you family .
We recommend these cabins !
I have used Bright Futures for the last 7 years .
I have 3 children there and they are the Best .
They are like family .
Your children will be taken care of and loved by a professional staff .
I think that the re pretty good .
First of all , if you call for an appointment they wo n't tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one .
They also do n't tell you that they 're going to mail you an " application " to be admitted to be a patient .
I feel that the way some doctor s offices work around here is a little bit absurd so I 'm happy that these guys do n't do those two things in particlular .
Usually you can be seen the same week or maybe the following week .
The doctor did tell me that my male pattern baldness is due to my mother s father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but that 's a common misconception ( http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/hair-loss-10-08/hair-loss.htm ) .
In general I would say that the staff is attentive and nice .
But then again I was nice to them so that could have been why .
Anyhow , after reading some of the other reviews it seems like some of the other reviewers are expecting mircles .
If you want miracles you 'll have to go to 21st St .
It 's a pretty typical primary care office but for the area it 's very good .
They do n't do certain things that are really annoying about other offices .
The staff do occasionally get game info correct , but if you r looking fot a good game and are n't a nerd , do nt ask them .
The last time I did that I was suggested to buy oblivion when I told them I was looking for a fps .
I knew what it was and told the guy that it was n't a fps .
He tried to tell me it was when I told asked him if he knew what fps stood for and he had no clue .
Overall they are n't very knowledge about the type of games are on the market .
Drove all the way over from the highway ... closed at 7 .

BEST DENTIST EVER -
Very fast and efficient service .
I have had several dentists in my life , but Dr. Deters is by far my favorite .
I never wait in the waiting room more than two minutes and the cleanings are quick and painless .
The Worst Experience Ever !!!
I have worked with Ted Jurek at Decor and You , and it started out as a decent experience .
He was referred to me by a friend , who did n't have the best experience with Ted , but said that Ted was able to make up for his lack of preparedness at the end .
I figure I would give this company a chance .
However , after giving a required $ 500.00 ( NON REFUNDABLE ) deposit before seeing any plans or ideas , I was sorry I did .
We met a couple of weeks later , Ted was late .
He brought fabric books , and pictures of furniture only , which all came way over budget .
By the time we got to the budget i told him I could work with , there was basically no design .
Just curtains and a couple of accessories .
WHAT IS THAT ?????
This company is way too expensive with nothing to show for it .
Please everyone .... take heed and do n't get caught up in the hype about DECOR and YOU working with every budget ...
This is just a way for them to squirm their way into your precious pocket
Lovely People , Great Hats
I was saddened to see the reviews that claimed World Hats Mart has poor service .
It led me to believe that the reviewers simply had difficulty tolerating people with strongly - accented English .
The husband and wife who run this spot are lovely people .
We have had many conversations with them and they have always been extremely patient with me as I tried on multiple hats in search of the right costumes for my magic act .
I recommend them highly !
Took a laptop in for a video cable to be replaced .
Everything except the display worked fine before I took it in .
The video cable was replaced and suddenly the motherboard was dead .
Phone calls were n't returned when promised and the botched repair took a week longer than promised .
Grocery and Daily Needs Store
Before using FusionRetail Before installing FusionRetail store was running on a dos based software .
We were having a major problem in maintaining cash .
Being a grocery shop , maintaining 5000 different products was a challenging job .
Managing POS counter without barcoding was really a tough time .
How FusionRetail has overcome these issues ?
FusionRetail helps us to maintain the store in an organised way .
Usage of product barcodes and smooth maintenance of inventory with proper recording of transactions like sale , purchase and returns was never easy before .
How long does it take to train new people at work ?
Billing takes 15 minutes and back office jobs takes 1 day 's training How fast your support queries get answered ?
Over telephone , immediate .
On call , it takes a day to get our issues resolved .
It 's now called Sushi Lover .
Food is just okay .. wo n't crave it , but would n't mind coming back for a quick meal .
Natasha is the BEST photographer we have ever worked with .
She has a great way with children and is able to capture their personality as well as many spontaneous images .
You will not be disappointed with her work !!
Make You Feel Like a Number
Stay away from Kids First West Chester .
You NEVER get a human on the phone .
It 's impossible to get an appointment .
If you get caught in traffic and are a couple minutes late they make you re-schedule ... for 6 weeks later .
And worst of all your child feels like a number not a patient .
Go somewhere else .
Dr. White is the best !
AWFUL SERVICE !
After happily visiting Sear's Automotives in the past , I was shocked at the horrible service received at their Greensboro location .
I brought my car in on a Sunday to replace a shredded tire .
I waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop ( that is apparently what you are supposed to do , but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage , so you do n't see them drving up , and they purposely block the front pull - up that all other Sear's use ) .
Once inside , I had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before -- FINALLY -- a technician got to me .
Once I returned to pick up my car , you can believe I spent quite a bit MORE time standing around waiting .
I had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since I was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this was n't possible .
Once I actually got back in my car , it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel .
OK , one bad experience ... fine .
The following Friday , I returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tires , which were worn .
I adopted a 3.5 month old yellow lab last winter from the Dumb Friends League .
I eventually decided to just pay the balance even though the doctor has already been paid , but now the collection agency is trying to say another reversal of $ 160.00 has come through .
Very friendly people offering a brilliant service .
Cj and company did all that we ask and 10 times more .
He cross examined witnesses relentlessly and had them break down and tell the truth .
I would not have gone back , but I could n't find the particular tire they 'd used in stock anywhere else .
Once again , I waited for quite a bit before being attended to .
I got the order completed , and then questioned the technician since it came out about $ 40 less than I expected .
He said it was the same tire , and verified this , after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week .
However , when he printed out the service quote , I could see that it was NOT the correct tire , and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model .
So I pointed this out to him , at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock .
Ok -- fine .
So I got just my other rear tire replaced .
They promised it 'd be done within an hour , so I waited in the lobby .
Over two hours later ( and ten minutes before they closed ) my car was finally finished .
A few minutes after I left , I was called and informed that " I " left my wheel lock ( which they should have left in the car ) .
Of course , they would be closing in 5 minutes , so I would have to hurry up or get it the next day .
Of course I could n't make it back in time ( and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me ) .
The next day , no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in .
Of course , they could n't call him either to ask about it because apparently they do n't keep their employees ' phone numbers ( riiight ) , so I would have to return on Monday ( driving for 3 days now with no wheel lock should I get a flat ) .
On Monday I called and again it was a big to - do to find anyone who knew anything about it .
Supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening , but I 'm sure that will also be a huge ordeal .
The employees at this Sear's are completely apathetic and there did n't seem to be any sort of management that I could see .
I will never return there again ( and now have some serious doubts about the quality of work they actually performed on my car ) .
PAT testing quick & efficient
I rang SRD PAT testing and within 3 hours Scot had come to my premises and PAT tested all my our Spill The Whisky barn dance band equipment , and supplied a certificate for only 70 p per unit .
Fantastic , quick and efficient service .
How rare !
Well done .
Very poor customer service .
There are a couple decent people working there , but the rest are VERY dishonest , as well as rude , I have yet to hear the truth come out of their mouths .
Friendly staff , but definitely some problems
May , 2009 .
We were booked at the Sheraton with a number of other out - of - town wedding guests .
Got put into the wrong room the first night , and were quite surprised to have someone with the same room key trying to get in the door at 1:00 am !
Next day got moved into another room , on the same floor with other wedding guests .
There were 3 adults in our room but towels for only 2 , no linens for sofa bed .
In the second room it took 3 tries to get all the towels and linens we requested .
A package and some wedding cards were left in our first room .
They were sent to our second room and had been opened -- the ribbon - wrapped present , and all 3 envelopes .
Security in the hotel seemed to be excellent , but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items .
A mid-afternoon " fire drill " was disruptive , putting everyone out of the hotel .
When we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night , it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down .
The staff was friendly , especially the front desk female supervisor , and seemed to want to help , but too many unusual things happened to make us want to stay there again .
Bad Service
Definately wo n't be returning .
Travelled 40 mins after calling to see if a product was in stock .
Told that they had plenty .
Get there and there was nothing .
Not impressed !!!
A Definite No
Incompetent servers , kitchen and management .
Expect either undercooked or mushy food and lackluster service .
The investors put big bucks into the building but are clueless about what makes a good dining or bar experience .
Even the least discriminating diner would know not to eat at Sprecher 's .
Good honest wrok
Harlan provides great service .
He is very knowledgeable and took the time to explain the repairs to me .
The work on my car was done quickly and I felt I could trust his work .
I have nothing but fantastic things to say .
I highly recommend his shop .
best quote ever My gate was stuck halfway open so I called A CLASS Garage Doors Dr Services .
They came to my house in no time and started working on the gate .
They were very friendly and were able to explain me exactly what was wrong with it .
Once they fixed it they answetred all of my questions with no hesitations and then gave me the best quote ever .
I know that if my garage door needs to be repaired , I will be calling A CLASS Garage Doors
When I arrived at Brickell Honda on 6/4/11 , I was greeted and attended to by the Sales Manager , Gustavo Guerra , in a very friendly and professional manner .
I explained to him what I wanted and that I previously went to Braman Honda .
Bramen Honda was a bit of a hassle .
He told me " no problem , we will match the offer or do better . "
Mr. Guerra gave me a better deal without any hassles nor any type of problems .
Brickell Honda has been the best buying experience in the world .
I urge all St. Thomas the Apostle parishioners and all of South Florida residents to come see Gus !!!
Excellent customer service !!!
Watch out for your wallet
Watch out for your wallet !
This company is overpriced for their services .
They pride themselves on being an event and team building company for corporate clients but you better believe they are going to mark you up on that feel good premise .
On a recent event quote that I had done , they came in thousands of dollars over their local competition .
The craziest part is that they are n't even based locally at the city I 'm in - they just have ' teams ' in areas through the country .
I 've spoken to vendors who are used by them who had nothing good to say about the company as well and in fact were afraid to quote events against them even though they openly admitted that they felt Canadian Outback was pricing their entertainment out of the market and doing more to hurt their business than help them .
Be warned - they 'll ltake you for everything they can .
Tire Gooroo
David Bundren is the Tire GooRoo .
They really go above and beyond !
For example , I actually forgot to feed my cat , and they went out of their way to take care of him .
Additionally , when there was confusion ( my fault ) , they left me flowers along with a personalized gift .
They have been 100 % reliable and professional .
Definitely recommend !
We have been blessed to find Elite Flyers online and would not use anyone else to handle our postcards , posters , etc .
We were looking for a company with decent rates as our company was just getting started .
They have the best rates and GREAT customer service .
On one order , we needed it rushed and shipped to a different state .
I also appreciate their honesty .
I sent a graphic that would have been distorted if printed as it was .
They called and worked with me to fix it so that it would look perfect .
They recently surprised me a larger order .
I ordered 1000 postcards , we normally order 5000 or more .
Because they had room to do 5000 , they created the larger amount , and shipped them early .
I recommend this company to ANYONE and everyone that needs great work done at a reasonable rate !
They have a customer for life in us !
such a great idea this was , so easy to load and pack , no ramp , no step up no back aches .
Very knowledgeable and friendly design build firm .
They specialize in financial institutions , medical , and retail projects .
These guys know what they 're doing and helped me in all phases of our project .
This place has the best baby and children s clothes .
Especially high end keep sake sort of clothing that you just ca nt find in a lot of stores .
It is all very unique and you wo nt find any other baby wearing the same stuff .
I spent quite a bit because I spoil my little princess .
UGH !!!
Got some nice " freshly baked " fruit squares , a personal favorite of mine .
Took a bite , it tasted odd .
Flipped the square over and saw it riddled with green mold !!!!
Ugh !!
I called the store and the clerk giggled , and agreed that it was gross , but said it was not her problem .
She also refused to get a manager .
I left my number , or tried to anyway .
Same clerk had considerable difficulty taking down a number .
I 'll never go back there again
Mezza Luna FTW !
their mezza luna's are deffly better than the pizza rolls .
it seems like it s healthier too , but it s prolly not .
that cuts down on teh wait time , cus u can do other stuff while u r waiting .
their pizza was a little salty for me , but it s still good .
they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layers of cheese for + 32 delicious .
anyways , the mezza luna : you should try it .
it runs you about 4 bucks and it deals crushing blows to hunger .
Perhaps they do n't deliver anymore , but the deliciousness of a mezza luna certainly warrants a pickup .
You 've Got Maids did a fabulous job cleaning my home .
I am hiring them to come once a week now that they got my house to where they can maintain it for only an hour and a half every two weeks !
Satisfactory for sure with the sercvice !
Beats having one " cleaning lady " who took twice as long and did not do a very through job like the " maids " did !
From the outside Ichiban looks like it will be terrible .
The food is amazing , and the prices can not be beat .
The sushi is great , and they have a great selection .
Quit with the overstatements !
The worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that " everyone " is going to " love " the food , decor and service .
The truth is , in my and my dining partners ' experience , this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food .
It 's an entirely up and down experience , however .
Now , the best of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal .
The salatim salads are the smallest plates I 've ever seen placed in front of me ( you would most likely think they were condiments if it were n't explained to you ) .
Though they are mostly excellent , you generally do n't get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them .
That being said , the laffa and hummus are out of this world .
Then again , for the three of us who dined together , two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more , and licking the hummus from our fingers ( and yes , those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three - person order ) .
Dinner was also an up - and - down experience .
The vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot - on , while the lamb was often dry and / or overcooked .
The duck was a 65 % glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy , crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments .
Dessert was ... hmmm , that 's interesting , I do n't even remember dessert .
I guess that tells you a lot .
Oh , yes , the chocolate semifreddo was quite good .
And my -- no , I still do n't remember what I had .
Service was average , but nothing special , and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly , not merely capable .
Perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing Zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests ( and as the many golden reviews seem to attest ) , we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience .
But one should not go here expecting something fantastic , unless perhaps you 've never had middle - eastern food before , or succulent duck , tasty lamb , decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts .
Did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all , and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience ?
find another place
Run down .
Dark , dark main room .
No way to read / relax .
' Electric ' blanket on one bed did not heat .
Quite cold .
Removing 90 % of ' sit - abouts ' in main room would look cleaner .
Food is always good
really amazing the new and exciting plays done at this theatre !
No service .. But good food ..
Surprisingly , this little strip mall restaurant has the best sushi I 've found in the Tampa area .
It 's fresh and really tasty .
I 'll drive an hour just for their volcano , yum !
Outstanding service & quality at a very affordable price !
This place is top notch and highly affordable !
I would recommend it hands down and am a loyal customer .
I 've also sent over a number of friends to use the services here and everyone is extraordinarily pleased !
Thanks for doing such great work on my important pieces of clothing that always look great !
Extremely helpful and professional
As first - time home buyers , my husband and I found Stephanie Fairchild at Prudential Steamboat Realty , extremely helpful .
She worked with us for over a year , helping us find our perfect home .
Stephanie 's knowledge of the market and properties in our price range , made us feel secure in our decision to buy when we did .
We would highly recommend Stephanie to anyone looking for a home in the Yampa Valley .
We appreciated her patience , knowledge and kindness !
ONe of a few .
Hancocks is one of four fabric stores in Fort Smith .
We have Hobby Lobby , Just for Fun Fabrics , Walmart , and Interior Mall just inside Barling .
They do have a good selection of fabric and notions .
The company gets busy but you never have to wait long because they ARE orginizied , so you are in , out , and paid well for your scrap
Favorite place in Tampa .
Update : I had to add to my review .
I was just in last night and had a chance to dine in their new dining room .
AMAZING !
I frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch .
Well I was in for a treat when I was greeted by the friendly girls at the counter who asked if my wife and I would like to sit in their " new " dining room .
Right away they told us that it was the same great food with the same prices so off we went .
We were greeted again and sat promptly .
After looking at the menu and seeing the new menu items they had , we knew we were in for a treat !
I had the Chicken Parmesan Dinner and my wife had the Shrimp Scampi Dinner .
AMAZING !
The portions were generous enough that we even took some home !
I have to say the value of this place always amazes me .
It 's nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that has upscale service , amazing atmosphere , and Incredible food , but not break the bank while enjoying it !
Bottom line is that when it 's a small privatly owned resturant like this is you can tell that the owners and employees take pride in their product and service .
Well Done !
Used their service for the first time and was immediately impressed by their professionalism ( received a phone call soon after order was placed to confirm details ) and the subsequent delivery of my gift ( To Split , Croatia ) was as requested .
The gift itself was exactly as described and pictured in the catalogue and of the highest standard .
Would highly recommend to anyone requiring overseas gift delivery .
Danny ( Australia )
Give them a try !
The pizzas are huge and super delicious .
They 're our favorite pizza place to order from ... and they 're a local , family owned company !
How much better does it get ?!
We were expecting a great experience , when we recieved a friendly greeting by the hosts .
The atmosphere was nice and very clean .
The menu had plenty of options even for picky eaters .
The service was ok , our waitress kept forgetting our drinks even though we reminded her several times .
To start we tried the guacamole and salsa verde , it was completly flavorless .
We should have left then .
We orderd our meals anyway , chimichangas , jalapeno borritos , and quesadillas .
Everything was bland , completely void of any spice or flavor .
We have never had mexican food this bad , it was just simply gross .
Over-rated ...
This restaurant is over-rated .
It is hard to find ... and the mexican food is bland , almost equivalent to eating out of a can .
The service is poor ...
I asked for a fried egg on my enchiladas ... and did not get it .!
Secondly , the enchladas did not come with enchilada sauce .. but chili ... like Hormel 's chili .. the cheese was American cheese !
The Chili Relleno .. had no batter on it .
Wife and I attempted to adopt a dog and was nothing but frustrating .
We were told that we could n't today because they were closing soon .
I called the next morning to let then know my wife would be driving in .
They gave me the run around and missing paperwork only to call back to tell me someone else wanted her and I would need to come in and put down a deposit .
I work 2 hours away but offered my card over the phone .
They refused .
Terrible communication as well .
At one point they told me the dog had been fixed , the next day it had n't .
Huge ammount of time wasted time and elevated blood pressure .
Want a great burger ?
The smokehouse ca n't be beat anywhere .
Salad bar is hit and miss for freshness - sometimes the broccoli looks browned around the edges .
Never a bad smokehouse burger though !
I crave those .
BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT EVER !!!
It was the best Chinese food I have ever had .
All the food tasted excellent , and with the new renovation of chairs and the bathroom , it is awesome .
The people working their are also extremely polite and friendly .
Every time I go , Kevin , the manager , will always remember my family and I .
Overall , it is very family oriented , and I recommend it to everyone !!!
Poor Experience
I did not have a good experience w / Dr. Ghassemlou .
During the session , he demanded to have my physical address , which I 've always kept private as I am enrolled in a witness protection program .
I believe he is correct in that he needs my physical address for legal reasons , however , he did not adequately explain this during our session .
I think he could 've done more to assuage my concerns by giving me concrete facts .
Saying that I need to give him my address or else I have intimacy issues is not helpful .
It 's pretty combative actually .
Buyer beware
Do not use these guys .
They 'll tell you one thing then $ 5,000 later do another .
Lied right to my face then denied it .
Run away .
It 's fine for ...
It 's fine for mass - market chocolate , but with companies like Scharffen Berger , TCHO , and smaller artisan chocolate makers in the area , why ?
Good food , good location , and good prices .
But the servers do n't pay attention to you whether it 's busy or not .
I found Bright Star Tours and Travels and Best and Affordable Tour Operators and Tours Agents in Chennai , India offered me Student Tour India Package for very less price .
I enjoyed my tour and i am looking for adventure tour and India heritage tours for valuable .
Thanks for Bright Star Tours .
Slice Pizza at former Britt 's Location
Britt 's Pizza is long gone .
Their location , the northwest corner of S. 10th & Federal Sts. , is now home to Slice Pizza .
Responsive , kept me apprised of status .
spot on
this kebab shop is one of the best around the meat is good and fresh and the chilly sauce is the best , keep them lovely kebabs coming and a happy new year to all the staff
The waiting staff is really friendly , it s like every one knows each other , the manager is really sweet and the food .. well no complaints from me .
Yes , it s that good .
Feel good
I just wanted to try your clinic because I was not totally happy with my current therapist I regularly see .
Now I 've found someone who can manage to do what I really want .
The staff leaves a lot to be desired .
The front staff has seen quite a bit of turnover and changed from professional to rude .
A simple follow - up phone call with a woman quickly turned into a nightmare .
She may be the reason for all the change .
I sincerely wonder if the doctor has a clue about what is going on within his practice .
If he does know and approves of this behavior then it is a poor reflection on him .
Sometimes it is not worth it to go through that kind of staff and their personal attitude to get to a doctor .
He was an okay doctor but not worth her .
Food - very good for a midnight meal that is n't fast food .
Service - the workers are usually pleasant .
Atmosphere is always fun , the assortment of customers adds entertainment to the meal
Nice little locally owned greek bar and grill .
Good food .
Great wings !
She has taken care of my sweet girl for almost 4 years now and I would not let Gracee go with anyone besides her !!!
Pure Beauty
What a joy to stroll off historic Canyon Road in Santa Fe into a gallery with a gorgeous diversity of art .
Destiny Allison 's metal sculptures were my favorite .
The owner Karla is welcoming and fun .
Give yourself the gift of visiting Winterowd Fine Art !
Thank you !
I recently took a rescue puppy to this Clinic and I was SHOCKED at how well Romeo and My family was treated .
They worked around the clock to ensure that my puppy life was saved .
We have to leave him at the vet for 3 days and I was told to call for check ups as often as I wished that no matter how many times I called I would not annoy them .
lol They where super friendly towards us and treated us like people not walking bags of cash .
In this day it s rare to find such wonderful people who CARE , Not the kind of want to make cash .
I would strongly suggest you give them the chance to prove to you that not all people in this world are evil !
I will never go to another vet as long as I have animals .
I live nearly two hours away and yet I will still make the drive to see them !
In fact I look forward to taking my animals to the vet simply because of how my animals and I are treated .
You will be happy at this store !
Allen Tire was recommended by friend after my having bad tire experiences in Temecula .
The store manager , Jim Smith , made an excellent tire recommendation for my newly acquired Lexus .
Tires were the right price and now the car feels like it is riding on rails around turns .
The store is clean , run very professionally and a pleasure to be in .
They know their job and you do not have to watch them to be sure everything is done right .
We are very pleased with the services of First Glass Window .
Our window panes were so dirty that they needed a specialist to come and clean them .
We called few companies before we decide to hire them .
They came on time and completed their work quickly .
We were very happy how clean looked our windows .
If you have some problems with your windows , you should call them .
A ++
They are by far the best salon in 50 miles , Trust me I know !!
excellent !
answered all my questions , and called me back when I needed something .
highly recommended !
Poor service
If you like the drama described in popular sitcom ' Seinfeld ' , you will see it here .
We signed our name in about 6:00 pm .
There were 3 names before us .
The greeter said there was about 15 minutes waiting .
However , we waited and waited and in the mean time , saw 4 groups of people simply just paraded in without signing there names .
This sign in policy is posted by the restaurant " no reservation , sign your name here " .
I had to ask the greeter , he explained his reasons with broken English .
I could not understand any his reasons .
I could only take it as they would seat the people they know first .
My conclusion is that you should only go there if you want to wait a least an hour and see all kinds other people being seated before you .
You guys do everything wonderful !
We honestly can not think of even 1 thing we did n't like !
My favorite cuban cafe in Orlando
I have been eating Cuban for a long time , sandwiches mainly along with other dishes ..
I love Cuban coffee , colada ... mmmm anyways I found this place and ca n't stop going there , I stop in at least once a week and anytime I 'm in the area for a Cuban coffee or snack .
The place is chill and comfortable .
They do n't speak the best English but enough to get by .
They bake bread fresh daily , they do n't press their sandwiches which is the way I like it , and the meat is always fresh .
They have a great lunch special with your choice of meat , chicken , steak , or pork and rice and black beans and fried plantains .
And their breakfast is awesome !!
I can not describe how delicious the mango and cheese pastries and the omelets are to die for .
Stop in and have a bite you wo n't regret it .
A slice of heaven in winter park off forsyth !
I really want to like this place since I work right around the corner .
Unfortunately , I 've given it a couple of tries at different times and decided to stop going .
The employees do n't really seem to enjoy what they are doing and it shows .
This place is clean and well run with great people .
The food is fresh and taste great .
Great value and service .
We will be back again and again !!
Perfect Practice
After I had chosen The Fountain Dental Practice they provided a slick and professional service from start to finish .
Everyone was friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself , putting me at my ease and explaining the whole process , both initially and then as we went along .
Surgery visit timings were always made to suit me and not them and they gave me the feeling that I mattered and was important to them .
The surgery itself is slick , modern and very relaxed and I always felt that I was in capable hands .
My dental surgeon , Dr. Lucy Nichols is clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work she does and the reputation she has established .
Everyone was so helpful that I can not wait to go back .....

Only Concerned With Money
I have been getting my treatments for a few months now and have seen some results but not up to the standards that I was told I should expect .
The people there attempt to come across and professional and nice , but I was disappointed with their customer service .
Never miss an appointment because they will charge you the price of a treatment , even if you had an emergency .
It 's pretty ridiculous !
They want to squeeze as much as they can from you even if you just got in a car accident !!!!
They do n't care one bit about you !!!!!
Dr. Strzalka at Flagship CVTS is not a good doctor
I am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there , but i do know from personal experience that Dr. Christopher T. Strzalka is not a man of his word , and is also very CRUEL AND UNCARING !!
He was going to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis .
I had a surgery date of July 17 , 2008 .
Then he renigged when he read my Health Care Proxy , even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for 2 months following surgery ( as he had twice stated i must agree to ) .
He later said that by 2 months he " meant at least two months " .
Two months and at least two months are totally different things .
He did not even give me the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer , which i would have .
A Health Care Proxy is not written in stone and can be changed .
He also never even said he was sorry .
Just said i was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room .
So , therefore , now he says i am inoperable ( even though i am not 100 % inoperable ) , and he is letting me die .
I am just middle aged and do not want to die , but thanks to this doctor i have no other alternatives .
I , along with my friends , consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he is not even trying to save my life by operating .
Even my PA i went to the other day said " it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you " .
He said it sarcastically .
If you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind , and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need , when they will not work for you , go to this doctor ... he is the one for you .
ok but just becuse we where on a tight budget .
me and my dad where in NJ for a kc chiefs ( my home team ) vs the NY jets and for game 4 of the world series .
i 'm a red sox fan so i was glad that the phillies won .
the knights inn was small very small . i mean 1 room in every room ! it was cozy a little and a small tv .
i mean a 2 day stay was a ok stay even tho the manager looked like he was chineze and that we only slept and went out from 8 to 7 to see New York .
but sice we almost just slept there i ca nt give that good of a review
Review on House of Joy Chinese Restaurant
My family and I moved to San Antonio a year ago and have tried almost all of the Chinese Restaurants because we love Chinese food .
Well it took us a while to find one that we liked .
But we do n't just like House of Joy WE LOVE IT .
Everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other Chinese restaurant in the San Antonio area we have been to -- and trust me we have been to a lot of them .
We just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the Bexar County Tax Office off of Bandera Road .
We stopped in and got some take out and can not stop going back .
They have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever tasted .
We also love their Egg Rolls and Spring Rolls .
And every entree we have ordered is perfect .
Everything is always cooked fresh and tastes fresh .
Their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive .
The staff is also just so pleasant to deal with .
They are also quick at getting your order out to you .
You do n't have to sit and wait around forever like most places !!
So anyone looking for an Excellent night out for Chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because I promise you 2 things --- You wo n't regret it !!
and you will go back for more !!!
Karla Ferguson - Granger
PS I have noticed on here that someone left a comment that " all of the nice comments must come from co workers or friends " and I will tell you that I do n't know these people except from eating at their restaurant .
We are from Virginia and just moved here a year ago .
So that comment is completely false .
Because we think IT 'S THE BEST !!!
and we do n't know them except for eating there .
ipad reiew
they are the best orthodontics in the world .
i went there since i was four .
now i will have really straight teeth .
Brain Dead
Not only are these people completely inefficient and ineffective , but they just do n't give a darn .
This place is a complete embarrassment .
the 2010 Genesis is grrrrrrrreeeaaat !
I am a proud owner of a brand new 2010 Hyundai Genesis .
I have never seen this car before until this lady at wal mart had it and she told me she got it here and that everyone was so nice to her .
I asked her who she worked with and she just told me ti was the sales manager .
I took the weekend off and came in and asked for the manager who is Jeff and he remembered her right away even remembered her dog , I was a bit shocked that someone would pay that close attention .
We got to talking and he got me set up and I test drove with Craig and I fell head over heels for this car all I kept saying , " was I got ta have it ! "
I thouhgt it would be out of my price range but they really worked with me and now I could nt be happier .
Jeff and Craig are really good at what they do and know exactly how to treat a customer .
Definitely go see them !
DO NOT GO HERE !!!
I went to get my nails filled Friday , by Monday 2 were broken .
I was not happy with the way they looked , very wavy , uneven edges , and with the exception of 1 , there is a dip in the center of each nail .
I also had a pedicure , and they cut my nails too short , one of my big toes looks like it s getting infected .
:)
I will gladly recommend you to anyone in need of or looking for a good florist .
BAD COFFEE , DO NT BOTHER !
Ca n't you make a decent cup of coffee ?
You charge SO MUCH , yet you use the same grounds over and over again .
The coffee taste BURNT and very bitter .
No amount of sugar and milk can mask it .
CHANGE THE PROCESS , PPL !
Westfield and Rt 1 do it well , WHY CA NT U ????
A most outstanding , professional firm .
Great help even near closing time !
I came in to town for a week and forgot my trainers !
Oh no !!
I came in 30 min before close and the staff was super helpful .
They spent a lot of time with me and got me into a great pair of shoes .
I think they may even be better than the pair I have been using this past year !
Thanks Run on !
Bulwark regarding service by Eric
Just wanted you to know that Eric came by as scheduled today and sprayed our house for scorpions .
He seemed to understand how important it was for us to make sure the whole house was sprayed so he took his time .
Thank you !
Excellent Physiotherapists !
Kusal Goonewardena and his team of Physios are unbelievable !
I have been suffering from back pain for over 12 years and have been to numerous specialists , physios , osteos and chiros with no help .
It took the Vigor team only 4 visits to get me feeling normal !
And now 2 months after my last appointment I am better than ever .
Thanks guys !
You are the only one auto glass repair shop in the area I would count on .
The Best Breakfast in Solana Beach !
We love T 's Cafe !
Without a doubt the best place to grab a tall bloody mary and some eggs benedict .
T 's has been a North County landmark for thirty years and with good reason .
Family owned and operated makes sure the atmosphere is relaxed and the food home - cooked with style .
I highly recommend picking up a jug of their homemade bloody mary mix - definitely the best .
If you 've been to North County , chances are it 's in your favorites list already .
This is my favorite coffee store .
Just ask American Express
Great People and even better service !
Best to deal with !
In a few words ... I 'm pleasantly surprised that you can still find " old school " service out there where company care more about good name and customers than their pockets ...
Highly recommended people / business .
Thanks Josh !
Thank you for helping me get more healthy !
I came in and saw Dr. Ruona about a month ago for quitting smoking .
I have to tell you that I have n't had one and do n't want one .
It is the easiest thing that I have ever done and I tell all my friends that they should do it too .
I sent a customer of mine to you .
Dr. Ruona , if you read this , thank you for helping me get more healthy .
I feel lighter and feel that I have more possibilities open to me now than I did before .
I ca n't thank you enough .
Love Hop City
This place is great !
Craig and Nate are wonderful .
I know now where to get all of my wine and beer .
No need to go to a grocer again .
Believe me .
This is THE premier university in Virginia .
It is also the largest .
With a Pizza Hut , IHOP , 3 Starbucks , Chili s , Panera , and Chipotle on campus ALONE , VCU has some of the best eating options for students .
VCU has the # 1 art school in America , and EXCELS in healthcare and medical schooling .
The Rams , the VCU sports team , also made the NCAA Final 4 this year , too !
VCU also offers high - rise living for students and professors , and the historic yet fixed - up houses in the Fan are also available to students , professors , or even people wanting to live in a safe , viable community .
VCU is also minutes from Downtown Richmond , Canal Walk , Carytown , Stony Point , Short Pump , and the VCU Medical Center .
It is the best university in Virginia and continuously receives rave reviews every year .
The U of R is also recommended , too !
Thanks For A Great Job
Thanks For The Prompt Service And Great Job You And Your Boys Have Done On Our New Solar System , The Panels On The Roof Look Great And The Power We Are Putting Back In To The Grid Is Great , Great Job Thanks
tricky short guy
The new management is tricky and talk you into getting video rental agreement .
To my surprise $ 20 deposit .... New movies not on shelf .. under the counter for Telugu Speaking people only ... or people who spend $ 30 or more groceries ..
That did it for me .. no more Raina 's .
Besides parking is a pain .. cramped and un-ruly with Kumon Parents next door .... gives me heebee gee bees'
Our company is a high end designer handbag and fashion accessories company , thus we are certainly a niche market .
We had been evaluating SEO providers for quite some time and finally decided to take the plunge with Stuart , and Ulistic .
We made the decision for a couple of reasons .
1 . Social Media .
We were familiar with Search Engine Optimization strategies , but new nothing about Social Media - we just heard that it was the next big thing .
2 . We really liked the fact that Stuart sets defined objectives and we meet once a month to go over our Key Performance Indicators .
How has it gone so far ?
Well we have been working with Ulistic for 1.5 months , and have 100 people following our site on Facebook , and our web site , www.designofashion.com has seen a 3 fold increase in traffic , which is significantly beating our expectations - SEO is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional .
We are absolutely confident that Stuart 's ethical and focused strategies will see these trends continue to grow , and our business will reap the rewards of this program .
Finally , it must be said that Stuart is a fantastic person to work with , because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because he is a genuinely good person and a great communicator .
Great Meal
Happened on to this place while out of town on business , and it was great !
The food was excellent and the service was terrific .
It is a cloth napkin kind of place , but I thought well worth it .
Ca n't say enough
I used to tan down the street before I was referred to this place by one of my friends .
WOW !
I did n't know what I was missing .
The lowest bed here is better than my last salon s highest level .
Salon is clean and girls are nice .
do NOT bring your car here
I got a coupon from Pennysaver for this station .
Yes , they accepted it .
However , during the test , they did whatever they can to get my test failed .
Then , they sold me overpriced stuffs , such as oil tank cap , so that my car can pass it right away .
I ended up paying much more .
This place is awesome
Great work , good price .
Definetely going back
not impressive enough
It 's a fine place , I 'm just a little mystified about the Michelin star .
Nothing wrong with it , just better options at this price point .
Best Limo Limousine service in all of Dallas
Great Limos company int he DFW fort Worth Metro area .
I use their limo services for all of my airport car services and airport transportation needs
My Favorite in McLean
My family loves coming to Endo Sushi . They are very nice , it is never crowded , and the food is wonderful , very delicious and fresh !
Sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront , and it is on a one - way street , but the restaurant itself is NEVER overcrowded .
If you can not park in the lot , then you can park in the shopping center 's garage , and walk up to Endo Sushi .
The service is fast .
Be sure to ring the little bell on your way out if you enjoyed your meal !
( it 's by the door , on the hostess stand )
Some of the nicest people and very good work standards
Amazing Pictures at an Amazing Price
Rendy is totally amazing .
She gave me amazing pictures at an amazing price and made my wedding day so memorable .
She was way easy to work with and made my wedding day so easy and she got some amazing pictures , not only of me , but of my family and friends .
She is amazing .
I would recommend her to anyone !
The best pizza ever i m fat so i ve had a ton of pizza other than pizza from chicago it s the best
Best Car Dealer in TX
I purchased a nissan from this dealship .
The sales men were very knowledgeable about every aspect of every car we looked at .
They were very patient and helpful from showing the cars to doing the paperwork .
The paperwork was a very easy and smooth .
They tried to run my credit score as less as possible so it wo n't hurt my score .
Overall , I was very happy with the customer service and my purchase .
If you 're looking to buy a car , definitely give them a call .
They have a huge inventory .
Great graphic design work !
Fresh Design Studio helped jump - start my own business by providing affordable and effective marketing materials : logo , flyers , posters ad design , and more .
They have unbeatable price in town and deliver on time .
I enjoy working with this architectural and graphic design firm and will recommend to anyone .
Great Prices , Great service !
I 've been to this shop twice ( once for an inspection and again for an oil change ) and they truly live up to their name : Discount !
They have all kind of coupons available for car washes , oil changes , state inspection , etc .
The thing is , you still get high quality service at nicely discounted rates !
There is even free coffee and bottles of water if you 'd like .
The owner is a pleasant guy and I would trust my car with him or any of his workers .
Top notch , all the way !
Did a great job of removing my tree in Conyers .
Thanks Southland .
Great work !
The people at Gulf Coast Siding were very easy and clear to work with .
They walked me through all the steps involved in the the installation project so that there were no surprises .
I found them extremely professional and would highly recommend them .
Thanks
Great food and nice people very pleasant experience .
Worst Apartments EVER
We lived here for 2 years , the first year or so was okay .
Then , the more power they gave to Linda , the worse the place got .
We were always having our water shut off , there were always people having parties at the pool , even after it was supposed to be closed .
The pool was supposed to close at 10 and they would have people down there until 11:45 yelling , playing music and do who - knows - what in the dark corners of the pool .
Then , when we moved out , we cleaned the apartment top to bottom , they came back and tried to charge us for two cleaning fees ( and we never got our deposit back ) and past utilities ( that were already paid , we have check numbers and records of this ) .
Linda is the rudest person you will ever talk to and she sticks up for all of the trashy , rude people that live there , not the nice ones that actually give a crap about respecting others .
Do not live here , you will regret it !
FANTASTIC STORE !!!
I came upon this store as the building caught my eye .
It 's located in the huge HONKA Log Homes building , by Walmart off of Evergreen Parkway .
The store was decorated with furnishings & accessories .
The friendly crew working was great & very helpful .
This store is what Colorado is all about .
Also , I purchased some furniture last year and all has been great !
It's durability & look was perfect and I will definitely be adding to my collection soon !
Restored my faith in Mechaincs .
I spent 3 months going from shop to shop trying to get my Ferrari to run and drive the way it should .
I was about to give up when I met Jason and Neal .
They took on the challenge of making my Ferrari all I dreamed of and more .
The crew at The Creative Workshop went over and above the call of duty and gave me back a car I can drive anywhere and finally enjoy owning .
I can not say enough about this place .
They have restored my faith in Mechanics .
Do yourself a favor , call these guys first and enjoy driving your car again ..
Rusted out and unsafe cars sold here !
Save money and go somewhere else !
good
it is a cute little nice and quiet library
OK Food , Slow service
The food was incredibly bland .
Their Thali was not brought out as described ( no saag ) .
Daniel and his assistant both did a great job .
Very professional and great results .
WOW what stunning views .
The furnishing and finishes are great .
best square slice around .
I feel obligated to share this story .
Right out of college I called the salon and explained my situation .
Just graduated , just moved , not rich , and starting new job soon .
I wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown .
Tmobile want to Send of my phone and i did n't want to go thru that ...
She says , Is that 17th like over past broad .
Hmmm , she says , Then why are you calling here , we do n't go past broad ?
17th , like over by 16th and 15th YES , I say , one mile west of you .
Great with SEO as well .
It was a very trying time for my family and myself yet Mike took the time to greet each and every one one of us .
Derrick did a terrible job , was a complete jerk the entire time , and I had no warning as to the price .
I 'm pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around .
Thank you Mike for all your help professionally and personally .
YES I am sure , well , she says , is that ON 17th STREET .
Yes , I say .
You 're at 7th .
I am just south of Walnut .
YES , I am west of broad .
Broad , I say , is 14th street and I am 3 blocks west of broad and one south of walnut .
Anyway , after much yelling and cussing I hung up , grabbed a cab , and went to Geno 's .
Easy registration , helpful staff and fun teachers !
The best company in Phuket for creating website and e-commerce website .
From first meeting with them to launch of my website , everything went smooth and on schedule .
Highly recommended for who wants to have website .
Great service
A very well established service with a satisfying outcome .
A well communicated and will be hireing again for another projects ......
Thanks
Friendly Efficient and overall great place for people in chronic intractable pain
Great place for people in chronic pain .
Staff is very friendly they treat you like a human being and not just another patient .
Very efficient at treating chronic pain !
Five minutes before my initial lesson , I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready .
They had a great selection of colors to choose from and their seats are super comfty .
They was about to Charge me $ 129 ...
I enjoy going there although i 've only been there once , i will be returning toda to recieve a pair of french tips and i will only go to the best and to me the best is here .
I am saying when comparing all other hotels in Wildwood , this hotel has everything that we are looking for .
A very good friend of mine highly recommended the Professional Driving School and I was told to specifically ask for Gerry .
I called the school most probably 10 times before I finally enrolled in a 20 hour package .
they save me from having to deal with Tmobile ...
( I 've been through at least 5 places already . )
He is very professional in his position as a director and yet he still made time to be compassionate for what we were all going through .
Both my grandparents looked as natural as could be expected .
I 've been to quite a few tattoo shops around this area and Stainless Steel is by far the best .
Yes my G 1 screen is back working .
I SAY LISTEN : I 'm at 17th and LOCUST , do you deliver there ?
He gives the phone to a girl , she says , I have to have your address , I say , do you deliver to 17th and locust , she says , your exact address , I say 1 - 7 - 0 - 1 Locust , ARe you sure ? she asks ?
So I say : I 'm at the Radison Warwick hotel in Rittenhouse Square ( built in 1926 ) do you deliver to the Warwick ?
STAY AWAY !
can ever & never forget the training undergone here which made my life step onto the successful job without any hurdles .
The staff , material provided , infra structure , environment & low fees totally above the satisfactory mark
The decor left a lot to be desired and the posters telling me all the reasons 99 was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality .
I love this place lots of people to talk to and school is across the street !
Andrew was helpful and knowledgeable about acupuncture re : infertility .
There 's a restaurant nearby ( walking distance ) with a great breakfast , and a market across the street .
The family suite was basically two rooms with a small opening between them which worked great for us because we were two families traveling together .
However , now that I have come to realize that I am going to owe the IRS $ 6,000 + despite doing exactly what Rod told me to do , I feel I have to voice my opinion .
~ It took over 40 mins to be taken to our table , once there it took another 20 mins to get our orders and a further 45 mins till our starters landed on our table .
Very frustrating for a restaurant that has 1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service ... hmm There was no canape's or amuse to keep us occupied , once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyone s attention .
On top of that though they tried to charge us service charge just to rub it it ....
Right near Chelan .
They have been my only " go - to " resource since we first did business together .
Outside of parking being at a premium , especially on discount days , The Laundry Tub is not filthy and it 's no smaller than any of a dozen laundromats I 've been in .
The beers were good , nice choice of beers as well , and as usual the mussels were great , the place upstairs is a nice addition to the bar downstairs .
Filled up on too much beer and hence can not comment on the food .
Worst experience ever like a sardine can and the bartender downstairs is the rudest person I have ever met .
He is my mechanic going forward !
It is next to Gare du Nord and a five minute walk to Sacre Coeur which is excellent for shopping .
It ALL had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for 2 weeks .
I do n't know if the kid had a bad day or what , but I had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue .
I worked with Andrew for 2 months and did acupuncture and herbs .
A large group of my friends and I rent almost the whole motel every year for a weekend , and the experience and stay have always been five - star .
I personally trust this Midas store with all my vehicles , I have been going there for years & would never go anywhere else !
I FUCKING HATE THIS PLACE EVERY TIME i GO THIS HOT CHICK SHOWS UP AND i MEAN REALLY HOT BUT SHE IS LIKE REAAAALLY DUMB AND THEN THEIR IS THIS OTHER CHICK THAT IS REALY UGLY BUT SHE IS LIKE SUPER SMART SHE COULD BE A SCIENTIST , BUT THEN THEIR IS THIS STONER WHO ALWAYS COMES HERE HIGH AND HE ALWAYS BRINGS HIS FUCKING DOG WHO IS SO HIGH FROM THE SECOND HAND SMOKE I THINK HE IS TRYING TO TALK .
With all the child predators out there , a busy road , cars speeding by ...... and you are going to let some 4 / 5 year olds wonder around cause you 're money hungry ?
I phoned this company for advice on our office refurb and although we did not use them in the end ( as our building contractor carried out the electrical work ) , they provided me with plenty of useful information over an hour phone call and subsequently we are now using PJC as our electrical maintenance contractor .
They did a very bad job with my hair and were extremely rude when I went back to ask them why it did n't work for my hair .
I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here .
remember to ask for extra vege
The portions were generous and we got out for less than the cost of one entree at some chain restaurant .
If you are in town and need that kind of space I say stay here but if you are looking for a little more upscale affair do n't let the pictures fool you and book somewhere else .
I expected to pay for this service , but imagine my surprise when I received a bill for MORE than what I paid to have the original return prepared .
I have use them four times for fixing items from pushing out a dent in a bumper to fixing the fender on my beloved Miata .
We visited on 7/26/08 for dinner We received a gift certificate for the Mama Mia 's on Greenfield Ave .
Sorry for interrupting I guess .
" Thank you so much for the superior job well done .
They picked my car up in Yarmouth and towed to Bath for a great price .
First , let me state that although I live in NYC , I am not from NYC , I do n't care about baseball and I absolutely love Boston to death ( so beautiful , so clean , so awesome ) .
Rcommended by bees , too !
You company and services will be recommended by us to everyone . "
The service was just about as good as I 'd get in NYC ( that means it was poor ) and the food was almost mediocre .
For instance I asked who owned Mazda and he said with confidence that was GM , which is n't true .
This shop is by far the best I have been to .
# 2 the decor is tasteful and artistic , from the comfortable chairs to the elegant light fixtures .... and ( most importantly ) # 3 the food is FANTASTIC .
And we bought a few cookies there too , they were fantastic as well ! )
I do n't want to waste my time on routes set for children , but I do n't want to take on something I ca n't handle just to strain myself to exhaustion .
Again , a great outing for the kids , a frustration for an out of town climber .
Would n't go back as there are a lot of places A LOT better and cheaper .
By the way , Salmagundi ( the store name ) means something like smorgasbord ; potpourri ; motley ; variety ; mixed bag ; miscellaneous assortment ; mixture , a variety of many kinds of things .
Comfortable and clean beds , a bit noisy when people were coming in late from a night out , but we did n't mind too much as we were also just coming in from a night out !
it was worth of the ride more than an hour ...
It was my birthday and I had a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre-made in a convenience store , but the problem was it was the day before Valentine s and when many bakeries turned me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake , Fiona stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful cake .
Asked why , Rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment ( it was an amended to show that I had purchased a home - nothing out of the ordinary , one would think ) and that took time to figure out .
Favorite DD spot in the area !
OMFG
ANYWAY WE DRIVE AROUND IN MY VAN AND SOLVE MYSTERYS AND SHIT
exelent Job
We love everything about the fence .
Quick and Cheap
Walked in and was out ta there in 10 mins with a really good deal i thought i was going to be paying a lot because i had a DUI but with my DUI and Sr - 22 they were able to get me the best deal out there .
Caldwell insurance has been doing our insurance for a couple years now and they have been extremely thorough .
We 've only had one urgent issue to deal with and they were very prompt in their response .
Highly recommend !
HORRIBLE !!!! !
This has to be some of the worst pizza I have ever had the misfortune of ordering .
The crust was lopsided , thicker on one side than the other .
It actually had a hole in one of the slices .
There was minimal cheese and sauce and it completely lacked flavor .
I know New York pizza and this is not it !!
This was nothing like New York style pizza !!!.
I love pizza and this was a complete and utter disappointment !!
I would not suggest this pizza to anyone !!!
One suspects that earlier reviewer works for another laundry .
Yes , there are bigger , but bigger is n't necessarily better .
I availed myself of the wash 'n fold service , taking just about a year 's worth of dirty clothes in and getting back neatly folded , clean clothes in clear plastic bags ( I 'd originally brought them in , in six large yellow garbage bags ) .
The cost was certainly reasonable and I will continue my patronage of The Laundry Tub in the future .
Will never use again .
Very rude and unprofessional .
The workers sped up and down the street with no mind to the small children playing .
professional
Good job very professional .
It made me feel good to see people work so hard to take care of others belongings .
These guys do great work at VERY reasonable prices .
I have never been disappointed .

Best place to sleep !!!!!!!
It 's helpful to know a quite a bit about bull fighting .
If you watch a lot of fights ( youtube ) and research some of the history ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullfighting ) you will find yourself enjoying it a lot more !
Also after seeing a handful of bullfights , I can say that they 're a lot more enjoyable if you 're smashed ( BAC >= .15 ) .
awesome place !!!
I had so many strawberries right on the field ... strongly recomend ... do nt forget to try their great ice cream
Good food , good wait staff , poor management
The food was good , and so was our waitress .
When it came time to pay the bill up front , they would not let me use any of the certificate for a tip ( which I have done with any other restaurant I 've gotten a gift certificate for . )
I then asked if I could have money back in cash .
The person went to go check with the manager , who was sitting at a table chatting with her friends who were eating there .
Her answer was short and manner rather rude .
There were no other options available ( I only brought my check card to cover any overage cost ) and she rang it up and applied it to the gift card before telling me about the tip policy .
I will not be visiting Mama Mia 's again .
There are other places with food just as good with management that values customers and employees much more .
They wo n't have a second chance from me .
The cashier was also short , unapologetic and made me feel as I was wasting her time .
I used Birdies for our Annual Walk Against Drugs and Alcohol event .
I 'm really surprised by the negative reviews .
green curry and red curry is awesome !
Feels like you are in Brooklyn , but people watching is entertaining .
Lovley food and fab chips
I would n't send my dogs there .
I had a conversation with the woman running this place in April 2010 .
She basically said if the children getting off the bus are n't paying to enter her building she was going to let them wander around the streets .
Wow , really ?
REAL CHRISTIAN OF YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Whether they pay me or not , if their parents get into an accident , stuck in traffic , etc. THE LAST THING I WOULD DO IS LET A CHILD GET RAPED BECAUSE I WAS N'T PAID .
Thoroughly recommended
Miami 's best tutoring service !
My son was able to advance a full two grades within 9 months !
A wonderful tutoring service for students needing help with elementary - middle school work .
Did n't hurt any that they knew my name by my second visit and greeted me warmly then and on my third visit .
Whereas my answer to the question " Where do you get your laundry done ? " used to be , " At the checkout line at WalMart , " I can honestly say the answer now is , " At The Laundry Tub . "

Good place to be on a Sunday Night .
But the menu had standard stuff that one would get at a Belgian Tavern .
If you are a handcraft beer person , this is a fantastic place to be .
Do not go to this salon , especially if you have to get your hair straightened .
