Understanding human language is a difficult task, with varied fields of study which aim at explaining and researching the human language faculty. Linguistics, Psychology and Computer Science all use domain specific tools to describe and model language. Natural Language Processing is the field which aims at using computational mechanisms to process naturally occurring human language. Modelling syntax gives language structure, but how do we model meaning? Using general sense classes, or ``supersenses'' we can potentially enrich texts with semantic information.

Given a simple arithmetic math problem in text form, is it possible to construct the right equation and derive the right answer?  


The goal of this project, was to create a system that is able to predict the right equation and answer for a given arithmetic math problem. Given the textual description of the problem and the alignments that are used to locate the extracted quantities, the system is able to compose an equation that will eventually lead to the right solution to the problem.  


The goal of this project is to create a Multiword Expression boundary and Supersense labelled sentence by training with Word, Part-Of-Speech, Multiword Expression and Supersense tagged training data. The semantically tagged sentences can be used for many tasks such as Question Answering systems, Information Retrieval, Discourse and Sentiment analysis.
